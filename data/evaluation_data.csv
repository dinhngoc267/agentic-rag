In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.
- Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.
- The steeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Summary: This unit introduces the concept of diffusion, explaining it as the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. It explores the role of diffusion in biological systems with examples such as perfume spreading in a room and gas exchange in living organisms. The unit also discusses important factors affecting the rate of diffusion: concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. Investigations demonstrate diffusion in liquids and how cell size and shape influence efficiency of diffusion. Adaptations like microvilli in epithelial cells illustrate how cells maximize surface area to optimize absorption. The unit closes with practical exercises and question prompts to consolidate understanding.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
Content: ### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

### Let's Investigate 2.2
Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios
1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.
2. Complete Table 2.1.

<table>
<caption>Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizes</caption>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 1 cm</th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 2 cm</th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 3 cm</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface area</td>
    <td>Area of one face<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm²<br>Surface area<br>= number of faces ×<br>area of one face<br>= 6 × 1 cm²<br>= 6 cm²</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Volume</td>
    <td>Volume<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface<br>area-to-<br>volume ratio</td>
    <td>6 cm² : 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

<tr>
<td>This cell can obtain food and oxygen from all its sides.</td>
<td>Portion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A.</td>
<td>Portion Z has an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

![Figure 2.8 Models to explain how cells of the same volume can have different surface areas]

<table>
<tr>
<th>Cell A</th>
<th>Cell B</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cell A: Surface area = 6 cm²<br>Volume = 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
<td>Cell B: Surface area = 10 cm²<br>Volume = 2 cm × 2 cm × 0.25 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
</tr>
</table>

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""
Person C: ""Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.""

**Hint:**
- Why is the colour of the tea darker in the region nearer to the tea bag when the tea bag is first placed in the water?
- What will the colour of the tea be after one hour?

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: Osmosis
Content: The cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar.

Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis

(a) Initial set-up:
- 10% sucrose solution (more solute molecules per unit volume) in arm A
- 5% sucrose solution (fewer solute molecules per unit volume) in arm B
- Partially permeable membrane separating the two arms
- Water molecules and sucrose molecules shown

(b) After osmosis:
- Rise in level of solution in arm A
- Drop in level due to movement of water molecules to A in arm B
- Partially permeable membrane still in place

Compared to arm B, arm A contains:
- More sucrose molecules per unit volume
- Fewer water molecules per unit volume

After some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.

What do you think has happened?
- Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane.
- Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.

Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).

The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis.

Let's Investigate 2.4
Aim: To demonstrate osmosis
Procedure:
1. Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.
2. Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.
3. Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled.
4. Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.
5. Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube.
6. After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment.

How can we show osmosis in living tissues (potato)?
Potato strips are commonly used in experiments to show osmosis in living tissues. The dimensions of the strips used are shown in Figure 2.27. For instructions on how to set up this experiment, refer to Experiment 2C of the Practical Workbook.
If the potato strips decrease in length, does this relate to water molecules leaving the strips? How can this experiment be extended to estimate the concentration of cell sap in the cell?

Let's Investigate 2.6
How can we show osmosis in living tissues (scape)?
A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.
One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)).

Unit Title: 2.3 What Is Active Transport?
Section Title: What Is Active Transport?
Content: Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport.

Active transport is the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.

Table 2.3 Differences between diffusion and active transport

#### Where Does Active Transport Occur?
Active transport occurs only in living cells because living cells respire. It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.

In the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.

In plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution (Figure 2.31).

```mermaid

```

Figure 2.31 Root hair cells take in dissolved mineral salts through diffusion as well as active transport.

#### Let's Practise 2.2
1. Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brine or syrups are used in food preservation.
2. An animal cell is placed in a concentrated solution of sugar. Which substance will leave the cell and which will move into the cell? What processes are involved?

#### Let's Practise 2.3

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: Investigations Demonstrating Osmosis in Living Tissues
Content: Let's Investigate 2.5
How can we show osmosis in living tissues (potato)?
Potato strips are commonly used in experiments to show osmosis in living tissues. The dimensions of the strips used are shown in Figure 2.27. For instructions on how to set up this experiment, refer to Experiment 2C of the Practical Workbook.
If the potato strips decrease in length, does this relate to water molecules leaving the strips? How can this experiment be extended to estimate the concentration of cell sap in the cell?

Figure 2.27 A potato strip used in osmosis experiments

Let's Investigate 2.6
How can we show osmosis in living tissues (scape)?
A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.
One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)).

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: Osmosis
Content: The cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar.

Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis

(a) Initial set-up:
- 10% sucrose solution (more solute molecules per unit volume) in arm A
- 5% sucrose solution (fewer solute molecules per unit volume) in arm B
- Partially permeable membrane separating the two arms
- Water molecules and sucrose molecules shown

(b) After osmosis:
- Rise in level of solution in arm A
- Drop in level due to movement of water molecules to A in arm B
- Partially permeable membrane still in place

Compared to arm B, arm A contains:
- More sucrose molecules per unit volume
- Fewer water molecules per unit volume

After some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.

What do you think has happened?
- Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane.
- Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.

Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).

The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis.

Let's Investigate 2.4
Aim: To demonstrate osmosis
Procedure:
1. Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.
2. Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.
3. Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled.
4. Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.
5. Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube.
6. After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment.

Unit Title: 3.1 What Are Carbohydrates?
Section Title: Carbohydrates
Content: Figure 3.1 shows food rich in carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates are organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms are present in the ratio 2:1.
For example:
- glucose has the formula CH12O (ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 12H : 6O = 2H : 1O)
- sucrose (cane sugar) has the formula CH22O (ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 22H : 11O = 2H : 1O)
Carbohydrates may be classified as single sugars, double sugars or complex carbohydrates (Figure 3.2).

Figure 3.2 Classification of carbohydrates
[An image shows various foods rich in carbohydrates including a bowl of white rice, a bowl of pasta, slices of bread, and some potato chips.]
Figure 3.1 Food rich in carbohydrates
Sugars are sweet and soluble in water. When dissolved in water, they will lower the water potential of the solution. Sugars provide us with energy to do work and carry out activities (Figure 3.3).
Glucose is found in plants and animals. Fructose is common in plants but rare in animals. The structure of glucose and fructose can be represented by the diagrams shown in Figure 3.4.
```mermaid

    B[/""\""]
```
Figure 3.4 Structures of glucose and fructose
### Double Sugars
A double sugar is formed when two single sugars are joined together. Common double sugars are maltose and sucrose.
Maltose (malt sugar) occurs in germinating grains. Maltose consists of two glucose molecules bonded together.
The equation below shows how a maltose molecule can be produced from two glucose molecules.

A sucrose molecule is made up of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule joined together.
glucose + fructose 162 sucrose
The structure of sucrose can be represented in a diagram as shown in Figure 3.5.

A double sugar can be split into two single sugar molecules by using an organic molecule called an enzyme. For example, when a solution of maltose is mixed with the enzyme maltase, glucose molecules are produced.

### Single Sugars
A single sugar is the basic unit of carbohydrate. It can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the cells.
The common single sugars are glucose and fructose (refer to Table 3.1). They both have the same chemical formula, C6H12O, but their atoms are arranged differently within the molecules. These different arrangements give the sugars different chemical and biological properties.

| Single Sugar | Occurrence |
|--------------|------------|
| Glucose      | Found in plants and animals |
| Fructose     | Common in plants, but rare in animals |

Figure 3.3 Sugars provide us with energy to do sports.
### How Can We Test for Reducing Sugars?
Glucose, fructose and maltose are also known as reducing sugars. Reducing sugars will produce a red precipitate when boiled with Benedict's solution (refer to Let's Investigate 3.1). Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar and will not give a red precipitate with this test.
#### Let's Investigate 3.1
Aim
To test for the presence of reducing sugars in different food samples using Benedict's solution
Procedure
1. Place 2 cm of each food sample into a test-tube (Figure 3.6).
2. Add 2 cm of Benedict's solution to the food sample (Figure 3.7).
3. Shake the mixture and place the test-tube in a boiling water-bath for 26 minutes (Figure 3.8).
4. Record the colour of the solution.
Observation
Table 3.2 shows the colour changes observed when carrying out the Benedict's test with increasing amounts of reducing sugar.

| Observation                                 | Amount Present         |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Solution remained blue                       | No reducing sugar     |
| Benedict's solution turned from blue to green | Traces of reducing sugar |
| Benedict's solution turned from blue to yellow or orange | Moderate amount of reducing sugar |
| Benedict's solution turned from blue to red / Red precipitate formed | Large amount of reducing sugar |

Figure 3.9 shows the colour change from blue to red indicating an increasing amount of reducing sugar present in the solutions.
### Complex Carbohydrates
#### What Are Complex Carbohydrates?
A complex carbohydrate is made up of many similar molecules of single sugar joined together to form a large molecule.
Starch, glycogen and cellulose are complex carbohydrates made up of numerous glucose molecules. The glucose molecules are linked in different ways, giving rise to different structures. Hence, starch, glycogen and cellulose have different chemical and biological properties. They also have different roles as shown in Table 3.3.

| Complex Carbohydrate | Structure                                                                                 | Role                                                                                                         | Occurrence                                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Starch              | A starch molecule is made up of several thousand glucose molecules joined together.      | It is a storage form of carbohydrates in plants. When needed, it can be digested to glucose to provide energy for cell activities.        | Found in storage organs of plants, e.g. potato tubers and tapioca |
| Cellulose           | A cellulose molecule is made up of many glucose molecules joined together. The bonds between glucose units are different from that in starch. | The cellulose cell wall protects plant cells from bursting or damage. Cellulose cannot be digested in our intestines. They serve as dietary fibre that prevents constipation.           | Present in cell walls of plants              |
| Glycogen             | Glycogen is a branched molecule. It is made up of many glucose molecules joined together. | It is a storage form of carbohydrates in mammals. When needed, it is digested to glucose to provide energy for cell activities.               | Stored in the liver and muscles of mammals   |
#### Tech Connect
Fibre is found in vegetables and fruits. Fibre cannot be digested and we often find food high in fibre difficult to chew. This poses a problem for the elderly, who may not be able to chew food effectively.
Enter the technology of soluble fibre supplements! Engineers have applied their knowledge of what roughage can do for our digestive system. They also understand how roughage can exist as fibres that are soluble in water. The result of this is a powdery substance that we can dissolve in water, or even mix with food or with soup and drink down (Figure 3.11). Some supplements are tasteless and odourless, which makes them highly suitable for the taste-conscious consumer.
This is a good example of how engineers create a piece of technology out of what was originally a solution to a problem. The technology comes in the form of an industrial product that is available to the average consumer.
### Glycogen and Starch Are Stores of Glucose
Plants store glucose in the form of starch. Animals cannot make or store starch in their bodies. We get most of our carbohydrates from plants in the form of starch.
In animals, the main store of glucose is glycogen. Hence, glycogen is sometimes called 'animal starch'. In mammals, glycogen is stored mainly in the liver and the muscles (Figure 3.12).
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Starch<br>in plants] -->|consumed<br>and digested by<br>animals, forming| B[Glucose]
    B -->|stored in<br>animals as| C[Glycogen]
```
Figure 3.12 Glycogen and starch as stores of glucose
Glycogen and starch are suitable as storage materials in cells because:
- They are insoluble in water, so they do not change the water potential in the cells.
- They are large molecules that cannot diffuse through cell membranes, so they will not be lost from the cell.
- They can easily be easily broken down to glucose when needed, for example, in tissue respiration.
- Their molecules have compact shapes, so they occupy less space than all the individual glucose molecules that make up a glycogen or starch molecule.
### Breakdown of Starch
Starch in the foods we eat may be digested in our alimentary canal. When starch is digested, the bonds within the polysaccharide are broken and the glucose molecules are released.
The enzyme amylase digests starch to form the sugar maltose. Amylase cannot break maltose down to glucose. Maltose is hydrolysed to glucose by another enzyme, maltase. Note that complete digestion of starch gives glucose molecules (Figure 3.13).

### What Are the Functions of Carbohydrates?
Carbohydrates are needed:
- as a substrate for respiration, to provide energy for cell activities;
- to form supporting structures, for example, cell walls in plants;
- to be converted into other organic compounds such as amino acids and fats;
- for the formation of nucleic acids, for example, DNA;
- to synthesise lubricants, for example, mucus, which consists of a carbohydrate and a protein; and
- to synthesise the nectar in some flowers. Nectar is a sweet liquid that plants produce to attract insects.
### How Can We Test for Starch?
Starch can be detected by the iodine test. A few drops of iodine solution to any substance containing starch will produce a blue-black colour.
#### Let's Investigate 3.2
Aim: To test for the presence of starch in a food sample using iodine solution
Procedure:
1. Add a few drops of iodine in potassium iodide solution to a food sample.
2. Record your observations.
Observation: Iodine solution on the potato turns from brown to blue-black upon contact with starch in the food sample (Figure 3.14).
Figure 3.14 Iodine solution on the food sample turns from brown to blue-black.
#### Let's Practise 3.1
1. Describe how you would test for reducing sugars in a food sample.
2. Describe how you would test for starch in a food sample.
3. Outline the role of carbohydrates in the life of an organism.
4. What do you think will happen if you add some amylase to a starch solution and test the resulting solution with Benedict's solution after five minutes?

Unit Title: 2.3 What Is Active Transport?
Section Title: What Is Active Transport?
Content: Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport.

Active transport is the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.

Table 2.3 Differences between diffusion and active transport

#### Where Does Active Transport Occur?
Active transport occurs only in living cells because living cells respire. It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.

In the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.

In plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution (Figure 2.31).

Figure 2.31 Root hair cells take in dissolved mineral salts through diffusion as well as active transport.

#### Let's Practise 2.2
1. Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brine or syrups are used in food preservation.

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Introduction to Enzymes
Content: ### Learning Outcome
- Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in all metabolic reactions.

### Biological Catalysts
Biological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.

> A catalyst is a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction.

For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.
potassium chlorate(VII) <strong>strong heat</strong> 12 potassium chloride + oxygen

When potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced. If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide:
- allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and
- speeds up the reaction.
At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst (Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boiling or by changes in the pH of the solution.

In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes.

### Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts
Enzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.
Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.

### Enzymes Lower Activation Energy
Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed.
The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.2 Activation energy is needed to start a chemical reaction.
1. Imagine a chemical reaction as the process of rolling a huge stone (reactant) up a hill so that it rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products).
2. Activation energy is the energy needed to roll the stone up the hill. Once over the hill, the rest of the reaction occurs. The stone rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products are formed).
Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the 'height' of the 'hill'. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.
For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 6C).

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?
Content: A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.
Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).

A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall.

Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential
1. When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid.
4. As water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure.

Link: Human cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.

An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it.

Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potential

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?
Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.

Disciplinary Idea
Homeostasis, Co-ordination and Response
Through the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).

A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22).

Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential
1. When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp.
4. As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential.

Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.

Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential

Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?
Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts.

The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24).

Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata

Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis.

Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).

(b) Flaccid and plasmolysed plant cells

(a) Turgor pressure in the cells of the plant helps to keep this plant firm and upright.
(b) Loss of turgor due to excessive water loss may cause a plant to wilt.

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?
Content: The term 'water potential' is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.

When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

Figure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container

- Left side: more solute; lower water potential
- Right side: less solute, higher water potential
- Partially permeable membrane in the middle
- Water potential gradient established
- Water molecules move down a water potential gradient through a partially permeable membrane

Figure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis.
Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane.

Tech Connect
In Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs.
The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.

Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment system

Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.

Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore?

Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:
- water potential gradient
- distance over which water molecules need to move
- surface area-to-volume ratio

The surface area of the cell membrane helps with this movement. When a cell gets bigger, its volume grows faster than its surface area, so it has less surface area compared to its volume. This means the cell cannot get enough oxygen and food or get rid of waste quickly enough to stay healthy. That's why cells are usually small.

Big animals have many small cells instead of one big cell because many small cells have a larger total surface area to volume ratio. This helps the animal's body move materials in and out of cells faster and keeps the cells working well. If an animal had just one big cell, it would not be able to get enough oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the cell, and it would not survive.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
Content: ### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

### Let's Investigate 2.2
Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios
1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.
2. Complete Table 2.1.

<table>
<caption>Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizes</caption>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 1 cm</th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 2 cm</th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 3 cm</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface area</td>
    <td>Area of one face<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm²<br>Surface area<br>= number of faces ×<br>area of one face<br>= 6 × 1 cm²<br>= 6 cm²</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Volume</td>
    <td>Volume<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface<br>area-to-<br>volume ratio</td>
    <td>6 cm² : 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

<tr>
<td>This cell can obtain food and oxygen from all its sides.</td>
<td>Portion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A.</td>
<td>Portion Z has an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

![Figure 2.8 Models to explain how cells of the same volume can have different surface areas]

<table>
<tr>
<th>Cell A</th>
<th>Cell B</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cell A: Surface area = 6 cm²<br>Volume = 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
<td>Cell B: Surface area = 10 cm²<br>Volume = 2 cm × 2 cm × 0.25 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
</tr>
</table>

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""
Person C: ""Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.""

- Why is the colour of the tea darker in the region nearer to the tea bag when the tea bag is first placed in the water?
- What will the colour of the tea be after one hour?

Unit Title: 1.1 What Are Cells?
Summary: This unit introduces the fundamental concept of cells as the basic units of life, functioning as tiny chemical factories that perform essential biological processes. It covers the discovery and naming of cells, the use of microscopes to study cells, and the detailed structure and function of cell components including the cell membrane, cell wall, cytoplasm, nucleus, and various organelles such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, ribosomes, and vacuoles. The unit also compares typical plant and animal cells, highlighting key structural differences linked to their functions. Practical investigations using light microscopes to observe animal and plant cells are detailed, along with discussions on tissues, organs, and organ systems, emphasizing the organization and specialization within biological systems.

================
Unit Title: 1.2 How Are Cells Adapted to Their Functions?
Summary: This unit explains how cells are specialised for specific functions through structural adaptations. Differentiation allows cells to develop or lose structures to enhance their roles. Examples include red blood cells adapted for oxygen transport, muscle cells for contraction, and root hair cells for absorption. The unit also covers real-life applications such as plant tissue culture for crop improvement and using stem cells for medical treatments. Students practice identifying cell adaptations and their functions, explore diagrams of cell structures, and answer questions on organelles and cell types. The unit highlights modern scientific advances like cultured meat and bone marrow transplants, reinforcing the importance of cell specialization in biology and medicine.

Unit Title: 1.2 How Are Cells Adapted to Their Functions?
Section Title: Learning Outcome
Content: Explain how the structures of specialised cells are adapted to their functions (e.g. muscle cell – many mitochondria to supply more energy, root hair cell – large surface area of cell membrane for greater absorption, red blood cell – lack of nucleus allowing it to transport more oxygen).
There are many different types of cells in living organisms. These cells differ in size and shape and they perform specific functions. For example:
- the human body has liver cells, nerve cells and skin cells, and
- the bougainvillea plant has guard cells and root hair cells.
Some cells develop special structures or lose certain structures to enable them to carry out specific functions. This process of development is called differentiation.
> Differentiation is the process by which a cell becomes specialised for a specific function.

Unit Title: 1.1 What Are Cells?
Section Title: What Does a Cell Consist Of?
Content: A cell is a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.
While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm (Greek: protos = first; plasm = form).
Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities that allow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.

Cells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life.

The protoplasm of a cell is made up of three parts: the cell membrane (also known as cell surface membrane), cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 1.4).

Unit Title: 1.1 What Are Cells?
Section Title: How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?
Content: Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!
- Light microscopes magnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)).
- Electron microscopes magnify objects to more than 200 000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times) (Figure 1.2(b)).
A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.
- Light micrographs can come out as colour images.
- Electron micrographs are black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.
To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

Content: The term 'cells' was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667. He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the bark of a tree (Figure 1.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the boxes 'cells', just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.

Section Title: Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
Content: ### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

### Let's Investigate 2.2

From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

</table>

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""
Person C: ""Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.""

**Hint:**
- Why is the colour of the tea darker in the region nearer to the tea bag when the tea bag is first placed in the water?
- What will the colour of the tea be after one hour?

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?
Content: A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.
Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).

A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall.

Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential
1. When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid.
4. As water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure.

Link: Human cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.

An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it.

Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potential

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?
Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.

Disciplinary Idea
Homeostasis, Co-ordination and Response
Through the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).

A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22).

Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential
1. When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp.
4. As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential.

Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.

Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential

Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?
Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts.

The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24).

Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata

Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis.

Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).

(a) Turgid plant cells
(b) Flaccid and plasmolysed plant cells

(a) Turgor pressure in the cells of the plant helps to keep this plant firm and upright.
(b) Loss of turgor due to excessive water loss may cause a plant to wilt.

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Enzyme Functions and Naming
Content: ### What Reactions Do Enzymes Catalyse?
Some food molecules are large and insoluble in water. These molecules cannot diffuse through the cell membrane.
Enzymes are required to break these large molecules into simpler and smaller substances so that they are:
- soluble in water
- small enough to diffuse through the cell membrane (Figure 4.4)

Enzymes that are involved in digestion are known as digestive enzymes. Examples of digestive enzymes are:
- amylase 12 digests starch to maltose
- maltase 12 digests maltose to glucose
- protease 12 digests proteins to polypeptides, then to amino acids
- lipase 12 digests fats to fatty acids and glycerol

### Enzymes Either Build Up or Break Down Complex Substances
Enzymes are also involved in biological reactions. Enzyme-catalysed reactions can be classified into:
- reactions that build up complex substances (anabolic reactions)
- reactions that break down complex substances (catabolic reactions)

Figure 4.5 shows examples of processes in which enzymes are involved.

```
Figure 4.5 Two types of enzyme-catalysed reactions

From the above functions of enzymes, it is important to note that enzymes catalyse practically all the chemical reactions that occur in an organism. However, enzymes are produced only when they are needed. For example, digestive enzymes are produced only when there is food to digest in the alimentary canal.

![Figure 4.4 Only small molecules such as glucose and amino acids can pass through the cell membrane.]
The image shows a diagram of a cell membrane with various molecules. Large starch and protein molecules are shown outside the cell, unable to pass through the membrane. Enzymes like amylase, maltase, and protease break down these large molecules into smaller glucose and amino acid molecules, which can then pass through pores in the cell membrane into the cell's interior.

Unit Title: 1.1 What Are Cells?
Section Title: What Does a Cell Consist Of?
Content: A cell is a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.
While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm (Greek: protos = first; plasm = form).
Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities that allow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.

Cells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life.

The protoplasm of a cell is made up of three parts: the cell membrane (also known as cell surface membrane), cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 1.4).

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Summary: This unit introduces the concept of diffusion, explaining it as the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. It explores the role of diffusion in biological systems with examples such as perfume spreading in a room and gas exchange in living organisms. The unit also discusses important factors affecting the rate of diffusion: concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. Investigations demonstrate diffusion in liquids and how cell size and shape influence efficiency of diffusion. Adaptations like microvilli in epithelial cells illustrate how cells maximize surface area to optimize absorption. The unit closes with practical exercises and question prompts to consolidate understanding.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

<td>Portion Z has an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.</td>

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

![Figure 2.8 Models to explain how cells of the same volume can have different surface areas]

</tr>
</table>

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""
Person C: ""Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.""

**Hint:**
- Why is the colour of the tea darker in the region nearer to the tea bag when the tea bag is first placed in the water?
- What will the colour of the tea be after one hour?

Unit Title: 1.2 How Are Cells Adapted to Their Functions?
Summary: This unit explains how cells are specialised for specific functions through structural adaptations. Differentiation allows cells to develop or lose structures to enhance their roles. Examples include red blood cells adapted for oxygen transport, muscle cells for contraction, and root hair cells for absorption. The unit also covers real-life applications such as plant tissue culture for crop improvement and using stem cells for medical treatments. Students practice identifying cell adaptations and their functions, explore diagrams of cell structures, and answer questions on organelles and cell types. The unit highlights modern scientific advances like cultured meat and bone marrow transplants, reinforcing the importance of cell specialization in biology and medicine.

Section Title: How Is the Structure of a Cell Related to Its Function?
Content: Table 1.2 shows some specialised cells and how they have been modified for specific functions.

Red blood cell:
- Contains haemoglobin (a red pigment) which binds to oxygen and transports it around the body
- Has a circular, biconcave shape which increases the surface area-to-volume ratio so that oxygen can diffuse in and out at a higher rate
- Lacks a nucleus, enabling the cell to store more haemoglobin for transport of oxygen
- Is flexible and can squeeze through capillaries easily

Muscle cell:
- Is elongated and cylindrical in shape, contains many nuclei and mitochondria
- Has mitochondria to provide the energy for the contraction of the muscle cell

Root hair cell:
- Has a long and narrow root hair to increase the surface area-to-volume ratio to absorb water and mineral salts at a higher rate

Section Title: Learning Outcome
Content: Explain how the structures of specialised cells are adapted to their functions (e.g. muscle cell – many mitochondria to supply more energy, root hair cell – large surface area of cell membrane for greater absorption, red blood cell – lack of nucleus allowing it to transport more oxygen).
There are many different types of cells in living organisms. These cells differ in size and shape and they perform specific functions. For example:
- the human body has liver cells, nerve cells and skin cells, and
- the bougainvillea plant has guard cells and root hair cells.
Some cells develop special structures or lose certain structures to enable them to carry out specific functions. This process of development is called differentiation.

Unit Title: 1.1 What Are Cells?
Section Title: How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?
Content: Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!
- Light microscopes magnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)).
- Electron microscopes magnify objects to more than 200 000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times) (Figure 1.2(b)).
A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.
- Light micrographs can come out as colour images.
- Electron micrographs are black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.
To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport.

Summary: This unit explains the concept of active transport, an energy-dependent biological process where substances move across cell membranes against their concentration gradient. It contrasts active transport with diffusion, highlighting that active transport requires energy from respiration and a living cell membrane, whereas diffusion does not. The unit discusses where active transport occurs, providing examples such as glucose uptake in human intestinal cells and mineral salt absorption in plant root hairs.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
Content: ### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

### Let's Investigate 2.2
Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios
1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.
2. Complete Table 2.1.

<table>
<caption>Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizes</caption>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 1 cm</th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 2 cm</th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 3 cm</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface area</td>
    <td>Area of one face<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm²<br>Surface area<br>= number of faces ×<br>area of one face<br>= 6 × 1 cm²<br>= 6 cm²</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Volume</td>
    <td>Volume<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface<br>area-to-<br>volume ratio</td>
    <td>6 cm² : 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

![Figure 2.8 Models to explain how cells of the same volume can have different surface areas]

<th>Cell B</th>

<td>Cell B: Surface area = 10 cm²<br>Volume = 2 cm × 2 cm × 0.25 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
</tr>
</table>

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""
Person C: ""Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.""

**Hint:**
- Why is the colour of the tea darker in the region nearer to the tea bag when the tea bag is first placed in the water?
- What will the colour of the tea be after one hour?

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Summary: This unit introduces the concept of diffusion, explaining it as the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. It explores the role of diffusion in biological systems with examples such as perfume spreading in a room and gas exchange in living organisms. The unit also discusses important factors affecting the rate of diffusion: concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. Investigations demonstrate diffusion in liquids and how cell size and shape influence efficiency of diffusion. Adaptations like microvilli in epithelial cells illustrate how cells maximize surface area to optimize absorption. The unit closes with practical exercises and question prompts to consolidate understanding.

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Summary: This unit explores the concept of osmosis, its definition, and its effects on plant and animal tissues. It introduces osmosis as the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane and describes key experiments that demonstrate osmosis using sucrose solutions and dialysis tubing. The unit explains water potential and its role in osmosis, how water potential gradients drive the movement of water molecules from dilute to concentrated solutions, and presents the significance of turgor pressure in maintaining plant structure and function. It discusses how cells respond to solutions of varying water potential—becoming turgid, flaccid, or plasmolysed in plant cells and swelling or crenating in animal cells. The practical applications are illustrated via NEWater's reverse osmosis technology. Several investigations involving potato strips, scapes, and spinach stems are included to exemplify osmosis in living tissues. Additionally, the differences between diffusion and osmosis are summarized, providing a comprehensive understanding of this vital biological process.

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Enzyme Functions and Naming
Content: ### What Reactions Do Enzymes Catalyse?
Some food molecules are large and insoluble in water. These molecules cannot diffuse through the cell membrane.
Enzymes are required to break these large molecules into simpler and smaller substances so that they are:
- soluble in water
- small enough to diffuse through the cell membrane (Figure 4.4)

Enzymes that are involved in digestion are known as digestive enzymes. Examples of digestive enzymes are:
- amylase 12 digests starch to maltose
- maltase 12 digests maltose to glucose
- protease 12 digests proteins to polypeptides, then to amino acids
- lipase 12 digests fats to fatty acids and glycerol

### Enzymes Either Build Up or Break Down Complex Substances
Enzymes are also involved in biological reactions. Enzyme-catalysed reactions can be classified into:
- reactions that build up complex substances (anabolic reactions)
- reactions that break down complex substances (catabolic reactions)

Figure 4.5 Two types of enzyme-catalysed reactions

From the above functions of enzymes, it is important to note that enzymes catalyse practically all the chemical reactions that occur in an organism. However, enzymes are produced only when they are needed. For example, digestive enzymes are produced only when there is food to digest in the alimentary canal.

![Figure 4.4 Only small molecules such as glucose and amino acids can pass through the cell membrane.]
The image shows a diagram of a cell membrane with various molecules. Large starch and protein molecules are shown outside the cell, unable to pass through the membrane. Enzymes like amylase, maltase, and protease break down these large molecules into smaller glucose and amino acid molecules, which can then pass through pores in the cell membrane into the cell's interior.

Potato strips are commonly used in experiments to show osmosis in living tissues. The dimensions of the strips used are shown in Figure 2.27. For instructions on how to set up this experiment, refer to Experiment 2C of the Practical Workbook.
If the potato strips decrease in length, does this relate to water molecules leaving the strips? How can this experiment be extended to estimate the concentration of cell sap in the cell?

How can we show osmosis in living tissues (scape)?
A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.
One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)).

Section Title: What Is Active Transport?
Content: Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport.

Active transport is the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.

Table 2.3 Differences between diffusion and active transport

#### Where Does Active Transport Occur?
Active transport occurs only in living cells because living cells respire. It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.

In the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.

In plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution (Figure 2.31).

#### Let's Practise 2.2
1. Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brine or syrups are used in food preservation.

Unit Title: 2.3 What Is Active Transport?
Summary: This unit explains the concept of active transport, an energy-dependent biological process where substances move across cell membranes against their concentration gradient. It contrasts active transport with diffusion, highlighting that active transport requires energy from respiration and a living cell membrane, whereas diffusion does not. The unit discusses where active transport occurs, providing examples such as glucose uptake in human intestinal cells and mineral salt absorption in plant root hairs. Illustrations and tables support these explanations. Practice questions and a mapping activity further reinforce understanding. The unit concludes with related questions about nutrition and physiology, engaging learners in applying concepts to real-life contexts such as food preservation and athletic nutrition.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
Content: ### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

### Let's Investigate 2.2
Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios
1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.
2. Complete Table 2.1.

<table>
<caption>Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizes</caption>

  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 1 cm</th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 2 cm</th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 3 cm</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface area</td>
    <td>Area of one face<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm²<br>Surface area<br>= number of faces ×<br>area of one face<br>= 6 × 1 cm²<br>= 6 cm²</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Volume</td>
    <td>Volume<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface<br>area-to-<br>volume ratio</td>
    <td>6 cm² : 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

</tr>
</table>

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""
Person C: ""Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.""

**Hint:**
- Why is the colour of the tea darker in the region nearer to the tea bag when the tea bag is first placed in the water?
- What will the colour of the tea be after one hour?

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Introduction to Enzymes
Content: ### Learning Outcome
- Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in all metabolic reactions.

### Biological Catalysts
Biological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.

> A catalyst is a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction.

For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.
potassium chlorate(VII) <strong>strong heat</strong> 12 potassium chloride + oxygen

When potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced. If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide:
- allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and
- speeds up the reaction.
At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst (Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boiling or by changes in the pH of the solution.

In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes.

### Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts
Enzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.
Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.

### Enzymes Lower Activation Energy
Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed.
The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.2 Activation energy is needed to start a chemical reaction.
1. Imagine a chemical reaction as the process of rolling a huge stone (reactant) up a hill so that it rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products).
2. Activation energy is the energy needed to roll the stone up the hill. Once over the hill, the rest of the reaction occurs. The stone rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products are formed).
Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the 'height' of the 'hill'. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.
For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 6C).

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?
Content: A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.
Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).

A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall.

Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential
1. When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid.
4. As water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure.

Link: Human cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.

An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it.

Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potential

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?
Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.

Disciplinary Idea
Homeostasis, Co-ordination and Response
Through the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).

A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22).

Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential
1. When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp.
4. As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential.

Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.

Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential

Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?
Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts.

The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24).

Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata

Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis.

Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).

(a) Turgid plant cells
(b) Flaccid and plasmolysed plant cells

(a) Turgor pressure in the cells of the plant helps to keep this plant firm and upright.
(b) Loss of turgor due to excessive water loss may cause a plant to wilt.

Soil solution is a thin film of water that surrounds individual soil particles. It usually contains dissolved mineral salts or ions.

Unit Title: 1.1 What Are Cells?
Section Title: Imagining Cells as Chemical Factories
Content: All living things are made up of billions of tiny cells, just as a building is made of bricks. Cells are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of life.
What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:
- A cell takes in raw materials.
- Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.
- These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the body.
In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Summary: This unit introduces the concept of diffusion, explaining it as the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. It explores the role of diffusion in biological systems with examples such as perfume spreading in a room and gas exchange in living organisms. The unit also discusses important factors affecting the rate of diffusion: concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. Investigations demonstrate diffusion in liquids and how cell size and shape influence efficiency of diffusion. Adaptations like microvilli in epithelial cells illustrate how cells maximize surface area to optimize absorption. The unit closes with practical exercises and question prompts to consolidate understanding.

Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
Content: ### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

### Let's Investigate 2.2
Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios
1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.
2. Complete Table 2.1.

<table>
<caption>Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizes</caption>

  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface area</td>
    <td>Area of one face<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm²<br>Surface area<br>= number of faces ×<br>area of one face<br>= 6 × 1 cm²<br>= 6 cm²</td>
    <td></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface<br>area-to-<br>volume ratio</td>
    <td>6 cm² : 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

<tr>
<td>This cell can obtain food and oxygen from all its sides.</td>
<td>Portion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A.</td>
<td>Portion Z has an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

![Figure 2.8 Models to explain how cells of the same volume can have different surface areas]

<table>
<tr>
<th>Cell A</th>
<th>Cell B</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cell A: Surface area = 6 cm²<br>Volume = 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
<td>Cell B: Surface area = 10 cm²<br>Volume = 2 cm × 2 cm × 0.25 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
</tr>
</table>

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""
Person C: ""Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.""

**Hint:**
- Why is the colour of the tea darker in the region nearer to the tea bag when the tea bag is first placed in the water?
- What will the colour of the tea be after one hour?

Unit Title: 1.1 What Are Cells?
Section Title: Imagining Cells as Chemical Factories
Content: All living things are made up of billions of tiny cells, just as a building is made of bricks. Cells are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of life.
What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:
- A cell takes in raw materials.
- Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.
- These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the body.
In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body.
Figures: 


================
Unit Title: 1.2 How Are Cells Adapted to Their Functions?
Summary: This unit explains how cells are specialised for specific functions through structural adaptations. Differentiation allows cells to develop or lose structures to enhance their roles. Examples include red blood cells adapted for oxygen transport, muscle cells for contraction, and root hair cells for absorption. The unit also covers real-life applications such as plant tissue culture for crop improvement and using stem cells for medical treatments. Students practice identifying cell adaptations and their functions, explore diagrams of cell structures, and answer questions on organelles and cell types. The unit highlights modern scientific advances like cultured meat and bone marrow transplants, reinforcing the importance of cell specialization in biology and medicine.

================
Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?
Content: A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.
Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).

A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall.

Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential
1. When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid.
4. As water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure.

Link: Human cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.

An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it.

Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potential

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?
Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.

Disciplinary Idea
Homeostasis, Co-ordination and Response
Through the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).

A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22).

Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential
1. When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp.
4. As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential.

Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.

Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential

Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?
Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts.

The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24).

Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata

Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis.

Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).

(a) Turgid plant cells
(b) Flaccid and plasmolysed plant cells

(a) Turgor pressure in the cells of the plant helps to keep this plant firm and upright.
(b) Loss of turgor due to excessive water loss may cause a plant to wilt.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Summary: This unit introduces the concept of diffusion, explaining it as the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. It explores the role of diffusion in biological systems with examples such as perfume spreading in a room and gas exchange in living organisms. The unit also discusses important factors affecting the rate of diffusion: concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. Investigations demonstrate diffusion in liquids and how cell size and shape influence efficiency of diffusion. Adaptations like microvilli in epithelial cells illustrate how cells maximize surface area to optimize absorption. The unit closes with practical exercises and question prompts to consolidate understanding.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
Content: ### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

### Let's Investigate 2.2
Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios
1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.
2. Complete Table 2.1.

<table>
<caption>Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizes</caption>

  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface area</td>
    <td>Area of one face<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm²<br>Surface area<br>= number of faces ×<br>area of one face<br>= 6 × 1 cm²<br>= 6 cm²</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>

    <td>Surface<br>area-to-<br>volume ratio</td>
    <td>6 cm² : 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

<td>This cell can obtain food and oxygen from all its sides.</td>
<td>Portion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A.</td>
<td>Portion Z has an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

![Figure 2.8 Models to explain how cells of the same volume can have different surface areas]

<table>
<tr>
<th>Cell A</th>
<th>Cell B</th>

<tr>
<td>Cell A: Surface area = 6 cm²<br>Volume = 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
<td>Cell B: Surface area = 10 cm²<br>Volume = 2 cm × 2 cm × 0.25 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
</tr>
</table>

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""
Person C: ""Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.""

**Hint:**
- Why is the colour of the tea darker in the region nearer to the tea bag when the tea bag is first placed in the water?
- What will the colour of the tea be after one hour?

Unit Title: 4.2 What Are the Characteristics of Enzymes?
Summary: This unit explores the characteristics and function of enzymes. It explains the enzyme specificity using the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis, describing how enzymes have active sites uniquely shaped for their substrates forming enzyme-substrate complexes. The unit details how enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy and remain unchanged after reactions, making them efficient catalysts required in minute amounts. It investigates the effects of temperature and pH on enzyme activity, showing optimum conditions for maximum activity and how extreme conditions cause denaturation, leading to the loss of enzyme function. The unit includes practical experiments to demonstrate temperature and pH effects on enzymes, discusses enzyme roles in biological systems, and connects these concepts to real-world applications like biological detergents and vaccine storage.

Unit Title: 1.2 How Are Cells Adapted to Their Functions?
Summary: This unit explains how cells are specialised for specific functions through structural adaptations. Differentiation allows cells to develop or lose structures to enhance their roles. Examples include red blood cells adapted for oxygen transport, muscle cells for contraction, and root hair cells for absorption. The unit also covers real-life applications such as plant tissue culture for crop improvement and using stem cells for medical treatments. Students practice identifying cell adaptations and their functions, explore diagrams of cell structures, and answer questions on organelles and cell types. The unit highlights modern scientific advances like cultured meat and bone marrow transplants, reinforcing the importance of cell specialization in biology and medicine.

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Summary: This unit explores the concept of osmosis, its definition, and its effects on plant and animal tissues. It introduces osmosis as the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane and describes key experiments that demonstrate osmosis using sucrose solutions and dialysis tubing. The unit explains water potential and its role in osmosis, how water potential gradients drive the movement of water molecules from dilute to concentrated solutions, and presents the significance of turgor pressure in maintaining plant structure and function. It discusses how cells respond to solutions of varying water potential—becoming turgid, flaccid, or plasmolysed in plant cells and swelling or crenating in animal cells. The practical applications are illustrated via NEWater's reverse osmosis technology. Several investigations involving potato strips, scapes, and spinach stems are included to exemplify osmosis in living tissues. Additionally, the differences between diffusion and osmosis are summarized, providing a comprehensive understanding of this vital biological process.

Content: ### Characteristics of Enzymes

#### Enzymes Speed Up Chemical Reactions
Enzymes alter the rates of chemical reactions that occur in a cell. Enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy needed to start the reaction.

#### Enzymes Are Specific in Action
Enzymes have active sites. Only substrates with a shape complementary to the active site can fit into the enzymes. When an enzyme binds to its substrate, it forms an enzyme–substrate complex. However, high temperature, acids and alkalis can affect the shape of an enzyme and consequently its function.

#### Enzymes Are Required in Minute Amounts and Remain Unchanged at the End of Reactions
Enzymes are very efficient molecules. Since they remain unchanged in the reactions they catalyse, the same enzyme molecules can be used over and over again. Thus, a small amount of an enzyme can catalyse the reaction for a large amount of substrate. For example, just a spoonful of washing powder containing enzymes is enough to wash a large load of clothing.

Figure 4.10 Effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction
1. An enzyme is less active at low temperatures.
   At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low.
2. As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.
   Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation.
3. This is the optimum temperature, where the enzyme is most active.
   For most human enzymes, the optimum temperature is about 40–45 6C.
4. Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction.
   The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules.
5. At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been denatured.
   Most enzymes are denatured.
Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis.
Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme's active site (Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme's active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst.

4. The iodine solution turned blue-black when test-tube D₁ was tested for starch at the various 1-minute intervals.
**Conclusion**
1. The less time taken to digest starch, the more active the enzyme is.
   In this investigation, enzyme activity is measured by calculating
   $\frac{1}{T}$ (the reciprocal of the time taken to digest starch). What can you
   conclude about the effect of temperature on the activity of amylase
   from the graph of $\frac{1}{T}$ against temperature?

### Enzymes Are Affected by pH

Enzymes are affected by the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions in which they act. Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease in the stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinal enzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary from the optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes.

In Figure 4.13, point M indicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH of about 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) or alkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, the enzyme is completely denatured.

### Tech Connect

Some COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at low temperatures for them to be effective. In some instances, the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as 	670 6C.
At this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that could break down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccine are literally frozen to a halt. Scientists and engineers thus need to design, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain such sub-arctic temperatures. They also need to design and construct containers that can store and transport large quantities of the vaccines across the world, from the place where it is manufactured to reach different countries.
These special freezers and containers are examples of technology in action. Engineers apply their knowledge in cooling systems to design and build machines that work to prevent enzymatic reactions on the vaccine ingredients during storage and transport (Figure 4.14).

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Introduction to Enzymes
Content: ### Learning Outcome
- Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in all metabolic reactions.

### Biological Catalysts
Biological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.

> A catalyst is a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction.

For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.
potassium chlorate(VII) <strong>strong heat</strong> 12 potassium chloride + oxygen

When potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced. If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide:
- allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and
- speeds up the reaction.
At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst (Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boiling or by changes in the pH of the solution.

In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes.

### Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts
Enzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.
Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.

### Enzymes Lower Activation Energy
Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed.
The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.2 Activation energy is needed to start a chemical reaction.
1. Imagine a chemical reaction as the process of rolling a huge stone (reactant) up a hill so that it rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products).
2. Activation energy is the energy needed to roll the stone up the hill. Once over the hill, the rest of the reaction occurs. The stone rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products are formed).
Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the 'height' of the 'hill'. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.
For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 6C).

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Enzyme Functions and Naming
Content: ### What Reactions Do Enzymes Catalyse?
Some food molecules are large and insoluble in water. These molecules cannot diffuse through the cell membrane.
Enzymes are required to break these large molecules into simpler and smaller substances so that they are:
- soluble in water
- small enough to diffuse through the cell membrane (Figure 4.4)

Enzymes that are involved in digestion are known as digestive enzymes. Examples of digestive enzymes are:
- amylase 12 digests starch to maltose
- maltase 12 digests maltose to glucose
- protease 12 digests proteins to polypeptides, then to amino acids
- lipase 12 digests fats to fatty acids and glycerol

### Enzymes Either Build Up or Break Down Complex Substances
Enzymes are also involved in biological reactions. Enzyme-catalysed reactions can be classified into:
- reactions that build up complex substances (anabolic reactions)
- reactions that break down complex substances (catabolic reactions)

Figure 4.5 shows examples of processes in which enzymes are involved.

Both plant and animal cells produce the enzyme catalase to break down hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, hence removing the toxic effect.

    F --> L[In photosynthesis, glucose is synthesised from carbon dioxide and water. The chemical reactions involved in photosynthesis are controlled by enzymes.]
```
Figure 4.5 Two types of enzyme-catalysed reactions

From the above functions of enzymes, it is important to note that enzymes catalyse practically all the chemical reactions that occur in an organism. However, enzymes are produced only when they are needed. For example, digestive enzymes are produced only when there is food to digest in the alimentary canal.

![Figure 4.4 Only small molecules such as glucose and amino acids can pass through the cell membrane.]
The image shows a diagram of a cell membrane with various molecules. Large starch and protein molecules are shown outside the cell, unable to pass through the membrane. Enzymes like amylase, maltase, and protease break down these large molecules into smaller glucose and amino acid molecules, which can then pass through pores in the cell membrane into the cell's interior.

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Naming and Classification of Enzymes
Content: ### How Are Enzymes Named?
Previously, enzymes were simply named by the persons who discovered them. For example, pepsin (a type of protease) was discovered and named by a scientist, Theodor Schwann (Figure 4.6), who was studying digestive processes. 'Pepsin' means 'to digest' in Greek.
However, naming enzymes this way led to a lot of confusion. Nowadays, enzymes are named according to a scientific system. The name of each enzyme:
• shows the substance on which the enzyme acts
• ends in 'ase'
For example, lipase refers to an enzyme that acts on lipids.

Figure 4.6 Theodor Schwann, German physician and physiologist

### How Are Enzymes Classified?
Enzymes are classified according to the chemical reactions they catalyse. For example:
• carbohydrases are enzymes that digest carbohydrates
• proteases are enzymes that digest proteins
• lipases are enzymes that digest fats (lipids)

#### Let's Practise 4.1
1. (a) What is an enzyme?
   (b) What are the two types of reactions that enzymes catalyse?
2. The unripe fruit of the papaya tree contains a particular type of digestive enzyme that is often used to soften meat.
   (a) Infer the kind of organic molecule that this enzyme acts on.
   (b) Suggest how the enzyme may cause the effect of softening of meat.
3. Red blood cells contain a common enzyme known as catalase. What do you think would happen if a drop of blood was added to a solution of hydrogen peroxide?

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Summary: This unit introduces the concept of diffusion, explaining it as the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. It explores the role of diffusion in biological systems with examples such as perfume spreading in a room and gas exchange in living organisms. The unit also discusses important factors affecting the rate of diffusion: concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. Investigations demonstrate diffusion in liquids and how cell size and shape influence efficiency of diffusion. Adaptations like microvilli in epithelial cells illustrate how cells maximize surface area to optimize absorption. The unit closes with practical exercises and question prompts to consolidate understanding.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

Unit Title: 4.2 What Are the Characteristics of Enzymes?
Summary: This unit explores the characteristics and function of enzymes. It explains the enzyme specificity using the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis, describing how enzymes have active sites uniquely shaped for their substrates forming enzyme-substrate complexes. The unit details how enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy and remain unchanged after reactions, making them efficient catalysts required in minute amounts. It investigates the effects of temperature and pH on enzyme activity, showing optimum conditions for maximum activity and how extreme conditions cause denaturation, leading to the loss of enzyme function. The unit includes practical experiments to demonstrate temperature and pH effects on enzymes, discusses enzyme roles in biological systems, and connects these concepts to real-world applications like biological detergents and vaccine storage.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion
Content: Imagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.

Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place.

[The image shows an illustration of two people in a living room. One person has spilled a bottle of perfume, and perfume particles are shown spreading throughout the room.]

Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particles

1. Perfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.
2. Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a gas.
3. The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.
4. This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.

What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion?

In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient.

In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradient between A and B.

Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two regions.

The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3).

Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out

In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.
- Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.
- The steeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.

Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.

Section Title: Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
Content: ### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

### Let's Investigate 2.2
Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios
1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.
2. Complete Table 2.1.

<table>
<caption>Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizes</caption>

    <th>Cube<br>sides 2 cm</th>
    <th>Cube<br>sides 3 cm</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface area</td>
    <td>Area of one face<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm²<br>Surface area<br>= number of faces ×<br>area of one face<br>= 6 × 1 cm²<br>= 6 cm²</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Volume</td>
    <td>Volume<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface<br>area-to-<br>volume ratio</td>
    <td>6 cm² : 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

<td>This cell can obtain food and oxygen from all its sides.</td>
<td>Portion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A.</td>
<td>Portion Z has an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

![Figure 2.8 Models to explain how cells of the same volume can have different surface areas]

<td>Cell B: Surface area = 10 cm²<br>Volume = 2 cm × 2 cm × 0.25 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
</tr>
</table>

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""
Person C: ""Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.""

**Hint:**
- Why is the colour of the tea darker in the region nearer to the tea bag when the tea bag is first placed in the water?
- What will the colour of the tea be after one hour?

An enzyme is less active at low temperatures. At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low. 2. As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases. Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation. 3. This is the optimum temperature, where the enzyme is most active. For most human enzymes, the optimum temperature is about 40–45 °C. 4. Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction. The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules. 5. At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been denatured. Most enzymes are denatured. Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis. Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme's active site (Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme's active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst. ```mermaid graph LR A[folded protein with<br/>intact active site] --> B[denaturation] B --> C[denatured protein<br/>(active site is lost)] A --> D[substrate<br/>molecule] C --> E[substrate<br/>molecule] style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style D fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style E fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px ``` Figure 4.11 At temperatures above optimum, some enzymes are denatured.

Record the total time (T) taken (in minutes) for the starch in each test-tube to be completely digested. page_number: 33""]","Temperature, acids, and alkalis affect enzyme activity primarily by altering the enzyme's structure, particularly the shape of its active site. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy and are highly specific due to their active sites, which only fit substrates with complementary shapes. However, high temperature, acids, and alkalis can change the enzyme's shape, impairing its function. Experimental evidence shows that at low temperatures, enzyme activity is low because molecules move slowly, reducing collisions between enzyme and substrate. As temperature increases, enzyme activity rises until it reaches an optimum temperature (about 40–45 °C for most human enzymes), where the enzyme is most active. Beyond this optimum, enzyme activity rapidly decreases because the enzyme's active site begins to lose its shape, a process called denaturation. Denaturation is a change in the three-dimensional structure caused by heat or chemicals like acids and alkalis, resulting in the loss or alteration of the active site. When denatured, the substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme's active site, and the enzyme can no longer catalyze reactions. This was demonstrated experimentally by incubating starch and amylase solutions at different temperatures (0 °C, 37 °C, and 100 °C) and observing the time taken for starch digestion. At 37 °C, near the optimum temperature, digestion was fastest, while at 0 °C and 100 °C, digestion was slower or absent due to reduced enzyme activity or denaturation, respectively. Thus, temperature, acids, and alkalis affect enzyme activity by causing enzyme denaturation, which disrupts the active site and halts catalytic function.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer,"Temperature, acids, and alkalis can change the shape of enzymes and affect how well they work. When the temperature is too low, enzymes work slowly because molecules move slowly. As temperature rises, enzymes work faster until they reach the best temperature (optimum temperature), usually around 40–45°C for human enzymes. If the temperature gets too high, enzymes lose their shape, especially their active site, and can't work anymore. This is called denaturation. Acids and alkalis can also change the enzyme's shape and stop it from working by denaturing it.

Experiments show these effects: Figure 4.10 explains how enzyme activity changes with temperature, showing the increase to an optimum and then a rapid drop due to denaturation. Figure 4.11 shows that when enzymes are denatured, their active sites are lost, so substrates can't fit, and the enzyme can't catalyse reactions. The experiment in Let's Investigate 4.1 shows that enzymes work best at certain temperatures, and outside these temperatures, they work less or not at all. Also, Figure 4.13 shows how pH (acidity or alkalinity) affects enzyme activity, with enzymes working best at an optimum pH and denaturing at extreme pH levels.

So, temperature and pH affect enzyme activity by changing the enzyme's shape, especially the active site, which stops the enzyme from helping chemical reactions.","Unit Title: 4.2 What Are the Characteristics of Enzymes?

   $\frac{1}{T}$ (the reciprocal of the time taken to digest starch). What can you
   conclude about the effect of temperature on the activity of amylase
   from the graph of $\frac{1}{T}$ against temperature?

### Enzymes Are Affected by pH

Enzymes are affected by the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions in which they act. Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease in the stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinal enzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary from the optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes.

In Figure 4.13, point M indicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH of about 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) or alkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, the enzyme is completely denatured.

### Tech Connect

Some COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at low temperatures for them to be effective. In some instances, the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as 	670 6C.
At this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that could break down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccine are literally frozen to a halt. Scientists and engineers thus need to design, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain such sub-arctic temperatures. They also need to design and construct containers that can store and transport large quantities of the vaccines across the world, from the place where it is manufactured to reach different countries.
These special freezers and containers are examples of technology in action. Engineers apply their knowledge in cooling systems to design and build machines that work to prevent enzymatic reactions on the vaccine ingredients during storage and transport (Figure 4.14).

Unit Title: 4.2 What Are the Characteristics of Enzymes?
Section Title: How Does an Enzyme Work?
Content: Washing clothes in hot water is a traditional way of getting them very clean as the hot water helps in removing grease and dirt from soiled clothes. However, if you are using a biological washing detergent (Figure 4.7), which contains enzymes, it is recommended that you use lukewarm water instead of hot water. Why is this so? It is related to the nature of enzymes and how they function.

Figure 4.7 Enzyme-based biological detergent

Enzymes are highly specific in their action. For example, amylases only act on starch, and not on proteins or fats. Similarly, proteases act only on proteins, and lipases only on fats. This enzyme specificity means that each chemical reaction inside a cell is catalysed by a unique enzyme.

### Enzymes

An enzyme is specific in its action due to its three-dimensional shape. The 'lock-and-key' hypothesis explains how the shape of an enzyme affects the way it functions.

#### 'Lock-and-key' Hypothesis

The substances on which enzymes act are called substrates. For example, protein is the substrate on which a protease acts.

According to the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis, enzyme reactions depend on the presence of active sites (Figure 4.8). Active sites are grooves (depressions) or 'pockets' on the surface of an enzyme molecule into which the substrate molecule(s) with the matching shape can fit — just like a lock and key. The enzyme is the lock, and the substrate is the key.

**Disciplinary Idea**
**Structure and Function**
The structure of biological molecules affects their functions. For example, the structure of enzymes affects the substrates that can fit into the active site. This affects the reactions they catalyse.

Figure 4.8 Three-dimensional model of enzyme pepsin with its active site

When the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, an enzyme–substrate complex is formed. It is a temporary molecule formed when substrates bind to the enzyme. Reactions take place at the active site to convert the substrate molecule(s) into product molecule(s). The product molecule(s) separate(s) from the enzyme. The enzyme molecule remains unchanged and is free to combine again with more substrate molecules.

The general equation is: E + S ⇌ ES → E + P
where E = enzyme
      S = substrate(s)
      P = product(s).

The specific nature of an enzyme for its substrate is described in Figure 4.9.

Figure 4.9 The mode of action of an enzyme
1. An enzyme has a specific three-dimensional (3-D) shape. It has a depression called the active site. The substance on which the enzyme acts is called the substrate.
2. Only the substrate with a 3-D shape complementary to that of the active site can fit into the enzyme. This results in the formation of an enzyme–substrate complex. The enzyme is just like a lock and the substrate a key. The substrate fits into the enzyme just like a key fits into a lock. This is called the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis.
3. While the substrate is attached to the active site, a chemical reaction occurs. The substrate is converted to the products.
4. Later, the products leave the active site. The enzyme remains unchanged. It can catalyse another reaction.

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Introduction to Enzymes
Content: ### Learning Outcome
- Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in all metabolic reactions.

### Biological Catalysts
Biological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.

> A catalyst is a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction.

For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.
potassium chlorate(VII) <strong>strong heat</strong> 12 potassium chloride + oxygen

When potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced. If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide:
- allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and
- speeds up the reaction.
At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst (Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boiling or by changes in the pH of the solution.

In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes.

### Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts
Enzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.
Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.

### Enzymes Lower Activation Energy
Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed.
The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.2 Activation energy is needed to start a chemical reaction.
1. Imagine a chemical reaction as the process of rolling a huge stone (reactant) up a hill so that it rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products).
2. Activation energy is the energy needed to roll the stone up the hill. Once over the hill, the rest of the reaction occurs. The stone rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products are formed).
Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the 'height' of the 'hill'. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.
For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 6C).

Section Title: Naming and Classification of Enzymes
Content: ### How Are Enzymes Named?
Previously, enzymes were simply named by the persons who discovered them. For example, pepsin (a type of protease) was discovered and named by a scientist, Theodor Schwann (Figure 4.6), who was studying digestive processes. 'Pepsin' means 'to digest' in Greek.
However, naming enzymes this way led to a lot of confusion. Nowadays, enzymes are named according to a scientific system. The name of each enzyme:
• shows the substance on which the enzyme acts
• ends in 'ase'
For example, lipase refers to an enzyme that acts on lipids.

Figure 4.6 Theodor Schwann, German physician and physiologist

### How Are Enzymes Classified?
Enzymes are classified according to the chemical reactions they catalyse. For example:
• carbohydrases are enzymes that digest carbohydrates
• proteases are enzymes that digest proteins
• lipases are enzymes that digest fats (lipids)

#### Let's Practise 4.1

An enzyme is less active at low temperatures. At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low. 2. As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases. Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation. 3. This is the optimum temperature, where the enzyme is most active. For most human enzymes, the optimum temperature is about 40–45 °C. 4. Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction. The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules. 5. At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been denatured. Most enzymes are denatured. Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis. Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme's active site (Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme's active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst. ```mermaid graph LR A[folded protein with<br/>intact active site] --> B[denaturation] B --> C[denatured protein<br/>(active site is lost)] A --> D[substrate<br/>molecule] C --> E[substrate<br/>molecule] style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style D fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style E fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px ``` Figure 4.11 At temperatures above optimum, some enzymes are denatured.

Content: ### Characteristics of Enzymes

#### Enzymes Speed Up Chemical Reactions
Enzymes alter the rates of chemical reactions that occur in a cell. Enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy needed to start the reaction.

Figure 4.10 Effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction
1. An enzyme is less active at low temperatures.
   At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low.
2. As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.
   Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation.
3. This is the optimum temperature, where the enzyme is most active.
   For most human enzymes, the optimum temperature is about 40–45 6C.
4. Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction.
   The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules.
5. At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been denatured.
   Most enzymes are denatured.
Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis.
Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme's active site (Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme's active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst.

**Observation**
1. The iodine solution turned blue-black when test-tube A₁ was tested for starch at the various 1-minute intervals.
2. The iodine solution remained brown when test-tube B₁ was tested for starch after T minutes.
3. The iodine solution turned blue-black when test-tube C₁ was tested for starch at the various 1-minute intervals.
4. The iodine solution turned blue-black when test-tube D₁ was tested for starch at the various 1-minute intervals.
**Conclusion**
1. The less time taken to digest starch, the more active the enzyme is.
   In this investigation, enzyme activity is measured by calculating
   $\frac{1}{T}$ (the reciprocal of the time taken to digest starch). What can you
   conclude about the effect of temperature on the activity of amylase
   from the graph of $\frac{1}{T}$ against temperature?

### Enzymes Are Affected by pH

Enzymes are affected by the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions in which they act. Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease in the stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinal enzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary from the optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes.

In Figure 4.13, point M indicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH of about 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) or alkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, the enzyme is completely denatured.

### Tech Connect

Some COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at low temperatures for them to be effective. In some instances, the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as 	670 6C.
At this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that could break down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccine are literally frozen to a halt. Scientists and engineers thus need to design, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain such sub-arctic temperatures. They also need to design and construct containers that can store and transport large quantities of the vaccines across the world, from the place where it is manufactured to reach different countries.
These special freezers and containers are examples of technology in action. Engineers apply their knowledge in cooling systems to design and build machines that work to prevent enzymatic reactions on the vaccine ingredients during storage and transport (Figure 4.14).

Unit Title: 4.2 What Are the Characteristics of Enzymes?
Summary: This unit explores the characteristics and function of enzymes. It explains the enzyme specificity using the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis, describing how enzymes have active sites uniquely shaped for their substrates forming enzyme-substrate complexes. The unit details how enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy and remain unchanged after reactions, making them efficient catalysts required in minute amounts. It investigates the effects of temperature and pH on enzyme activity, showing optimum conditions for maximum activity and how extreme conditions cause denaturation, leading to the loss of enzyme function. The unit includes practical experiments to demonstrate temperature and pH effects on enzymes, discusses enzyme roles in biological systems, and connects these concepts to real-world applications like biological detergents and vaccine storage.

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Introduction to Enzymes
Content: ### Learning Outcome
- Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in all metabolic reactions.

### Biological Catalysts
Biological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.

> A catalyst is a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction.

For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.
potassium chlorate(VII) <strong>strong heat</strong> 12 potassium chloride + oxygen

When potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced. If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide:
- allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and
- speeds up the reaction.
At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst (Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boiling or by changes in the pH of the solution.

In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes.

### Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts
Enzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.
Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.

### Enzymes Lower Activation Energy
Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed.
The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.2 Activation energy is needed to start a chemical reaction.
1. Imagine a chemical reaction as the process of rolling a huge stone (reactant) up a hill so that it rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products).
2. Activation energy is the energy needed to roll the stone up the hill. Once over the hill, the rest of the reaction occurs. The stone rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products are formed).
Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the 'height' of the 'hill'. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.
For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 6C).

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Enzyme Functions and Naming
Content: ### What Reactions Do Enzymes Catalyse?
Some food molecules are large and insoluble in water. These molecules cannot diffuse through the cell membrane.
Enzymes are required to break these large molecules into simpler and smaller substances so that they are:
- soluble in water
- small enough to diffuse through the cell membrane (Figure 4.4)

Enzymes that are involved in digestion are known as digestive enzymes. Examples of digestive enzymes are:
- amylase 12 digests starch to maltose
- maltase 12 digests maltose to glucose
- protease 12 digests proteins to polypeptides, then to amino acids
- lipase 12 digests fats to fatty acids and glycerol

### Enzymes Either Build Up or Break Down Complex Substances
Enzymes are also involved in biological reactions. Enzyme-catalysed reactions can be classified into:
- reactions that build up complex substances (anabolic reactions)
- reactions that break down complex substances (catabolic reactions)

Figure 4.5 shows examples of processes in which enzymes are involved.

Both plant and animal cells produce the enzyme catalase to break down hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, hence removing the toxic effect. Catalase is especially abundant in blood and the liver of mammals.]
    F --> L[In photosynthesis, glucose is synthesised from carbon dioxide and water. The chemical reactions involved in photosynthesis are controlled by enzymes.]
```
Figure 4.5 Two types of enzyme-catalysed reactions

From the above functions of enzymes, it is important to note that enzymes catalyse practically all the chemical reactions that occur in an organism. However, enzymes are produced only when they are needed. For example, digestive enzymes are produced only when there is food to digest in the alimentary canal.

![Figure 4.4 Only small molecules such as glucose and amino acids can pass through the cell membrane.]
The image shows a diagram of a cell membrane with various molecules. Large starch and protein molecules are shown outside the cell, unable to pass through the membrane. Enzymes like amylase, maltase, and protease break down these large molecules into smaller glucose and amino acid molecules, which can then pass through pores in the cell membrane into the cell's interior.

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Naming and Classification of Enzymes
Content: ### How Are Enzymes Named?
Previously, enzymes were simply named by the persons who discovered them. For example, pepsin (a type of protease) was discovered and named by a scientist, Theodor Schwann (Figure 4.6), who was studying digestive processes. 'Pepsin' means 'to digest' in Greek.
However, naming enzymes this way led to a lot of confusion. Nowadays, enzymes are named according to a scientific system. The name of each enzyme:
• shows the substance on which the enzyme acts
• ends in 'ase'
For example, lipase refers to an enzyme that acts on lipids.

Figure 4.6 Theodor Schwann, German physician and physiologist

### How Are Enzymes Classified?
Enzymes are classified according to the chemical reactions they catalyse. For example:
• carbohydrases are enzymes that digest carbohydrates
• proteases are enzymes that digest proteins
• lipases are enzymes that digest fats (lipids)

#### Let's Practise 4.1
1. (a) What is an enzyme?
   (b) What are the two types of reactions that enzymes catalyse?
2. The unripe fruit of the papaya tree contains a particular type of digestive enzyme that is often used to soften meat.
   (a) Infer the kind of organic molecule that this enzyme acts on.
   (b) Suggest how the enzyme may cause the effect of softening of meat.
3. Red blood cells contain a common enzyme known as catalase. What do you think would happen if a drop of blood was added to a solution of hydrogen peroxide?

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Summary: This unit introduces the concept of diffusion, explaining it as the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. It explores the role of diffusion in biological systems with examples such as perfume spreading in a room and gas exchange in living organisms. The unit also discusses important factors affecting the rate of diffusion: concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. Investigations demonstrate diffusion in liquids and how cell size and shape influence efficiency of diffusion. Adaptations like microvilli in epithelial cells illustrate how cells maximize surface area to optimize absorption. The unit closes with practical exercises and question prompts to consolidate understanding.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion
Content: Imagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.

Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place.

[The image shows an illustration of two people in a living room. One person has spilled a bottle of perfume, and perfume particles are shown spreading throughout the room.]

Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particles

1. Perfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.
2. Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a gas.
3. The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.
4. This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.

What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion?

In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient.

In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradient between A and B.

Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two regions.

The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3).

Figure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion

Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out

In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.
- Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.
- The steeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.

Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Introduction to Enzymes
Content: ### Learning Outcome
- Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in all metabolic reactions.

### Biological Catalysts
Biological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.

> A catalyst is a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction.

For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.
potassium chlorate(VII) <strong>strong heat</strong> 12 potassium chloride + oxygen

When potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced. If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide:
- allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and
- speeds up the reaction.
At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst (Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boiling or by changes in the pH of the solution.

In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes.

### Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts
Enzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.
Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.

### Enzymes Lower Activation Energy
Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed.
The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.2 Activation energy is needed to start a chemical reaction.
1. Imagine a chemical reaction as the process of rolling a huge stone (reactant) up a hill so that it rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products).
2. Activation energy is the energy needed to roll the stone up the hill. Once over the hill, the rest of the reaction occurs. The stone rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products are formed).
Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the 'height' of the 'hill'. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.
For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 6C).

Note: If the overall energy change is negative, there is a decrease in energy content (as shown in graph). If the overall energy change is positive, there is an increase in energy content.

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: Osmosis
Content: The cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar.

Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis

(a) Initial set-up:
- 10% sucrose solution (more solute molecules per unit volume) in arm A
- 5% sucrose solution (fewer solute molecules per unit volume) in arm B
- Partially permeable membrane separating the two arms
- Water molecules and sucrose molecules shown

(b) After osmosis:
- Rise in level of solution in arm A
- Drop in level due to movement of water molecules to A in arm B
- Partially permeable membrane still in place

Compared to arm B, arm A contains:
- More sucrose molecules per unit volume
- Fewer water molecules per unit volume

After some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.

What do you think has happened?
- Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane.
- Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.

Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).

The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis.

4. Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.

Figure 2.16 shows an experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis using dialysis tubing filled with sucrose solution, placed in a boiling tube with distilled water.

Over time, the blue color spreads through the water. This happens because the copper(II) sulfate particles move from where they are more concentrated to where they are less concentrated. This movement of particles is called diffusion.

Figure 2.16 shows an experiment to demonstrate osmosis using dialysis tubing filled with sucrose solution and placed in distilled water. The dialysis tubing acts like a partially permeable membrane. Water moves through the tubing into the sucrose solution because water moves from an area with more water molecules (distilled water) to an area with fewer water molecules (sucrose solution). This movement of water through a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis.

Key observations:

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Summary: This unit explores the concept of osmosis, its definition, and its effects on plant and animal tissues. It introduces osmosis as the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane and describes key experiments that demonstrate osmosis using sucrose solutions and dialysis tubing. The unit explains water potential and its role in osmosis, how water potential gradients drive the movement of water molecules from dilute to concentrated solutions, and presents the significance of turgor pressure in maintaining plant structure and function. It discusses how cells respond to solutions of varying water potential—becoming turgid, flaccid, or plasmolysed in plant cells and swelling or crenating in animal cells. The practical applications are illustrated via NEWater's reverse osmosis technology. Several investigations involving potato strips, scapes, and spinach stems are included to exemplify osmosis in living tissues. Additionally, the differences between diffusion and osmosis are summarized, providing a comprehensive understanding of this vital biological process.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Summary: This unit introduces the concept of diffusion, explaining it as the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. It explores the role of diffusion in biological systems with examples such as perfume spreading in a room and gas exchange in living organisms. The unit also discusses important factors affecting the rate of diffusion: concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. Investigations demonstrate diffusion in liquids and how cell size and shape influence efficiency of diffusion. Adaptations like microvilli in epithelial cells illustrate how cells maximize surface area to optimize absorption. The unit closes with practical exercises and question prompts to consolidate understanding.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion
Content: Imagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.

Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place.

[The image shows an illustration of two people in a living room. One person has spilled a bottle of perfume, and perfume particles are shown spreading throughout the room.]

Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particles

1. Perfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.
2. Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a gas.
3. The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.
4. This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.

What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion?

In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient.

In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradient between A and B.

Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two regions.

The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3).

```mermaid

```

Figure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion

Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out

In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.
- Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.
- The steeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.

Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?
Content: A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.
Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).

A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall.

Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential
1. When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid.
4. As water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure.

Link: Human cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.

An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it.

Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potential

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?
Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.

Disciplinary Idea
Homeostasis, Co-ordination and Response
Through the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).

A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22).

Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential
1. When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp.
4. As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential.

Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.

Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential

Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?
Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts.

The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24).

Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata

Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis.

Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).

(a) Turgid plant cells
(b) Flaccid and plasmolysed plant cells

(a) Turgor pressure in the cells of the plant helps to keep this plant firm and upright.
(b) Loss of turgor due to excessive water loss may cause a plant to wilt.

Section Title: Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
Content: ### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

### Let's Investigate 2.2
Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios
1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.
2. Complete Table 2.1.

From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""
Person C: ""Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.""

Section Title: How Is the Structure of a Cell Related to Its Function?
Content: Table 1.2 shows some specialised cells and how they have been modified for specific functions.

Red blood cell:
- Contains haemoglobin (a red pigment) which binds to oxygen and transports it around the body
- Has a circular, biconcave shape which increases the surface area-to-volume ratio so that oxygen can diffuse in and out at a higher rate
- Lacks a nucleus, enabling the cell to store more haemoglobin for transport of oxygen
- Is flexible and can squeeze through capillaries easily

Muscle cell:
- Is elongated and cylindrical in shape, contains many nuclei and mitochondria
- Has mitochondria to provide the energy for the contraction of the muscle cell

Root hair cell:
- Has a long and narrow root hair to increase the surface area-to-volume ratio to absorb water and mineral salts at a higher rate

Unit Title: 1.2 How Are Cells Adapted to Their Functions?
Section Title: Learning Outcome
Content: Explain how the structures of specialised cells are adapted to their functions (e.g. muscle cell – many mitochondria to supply more energy, root hair cell – large surface area of cell membrane for greater absorption, red blood cell – lack of nucleus allowing it to transport more oxygen).
There are many different types of cells in living organisms. These cells differ in size and shape and they perform specific functions. For example:
- the human body has liver cells, nerve cells and skin cells, and
- the bougainvillea plant has guard cells and root hair cells.
Some cells develop special structures or lose certain structures to enable them to carry out specific functions. This process of development is called differentiation.
> Differentiation is the process by which a cell becomes specialised for a specific function.

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?
Content: A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.
Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).

A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall.

Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential
1. When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid.
4. As water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure.

Link: Human cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.

An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it.

Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potential

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?
Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.

Disciplinary Idea
Homeostasis, Co-ordination and Response
Through the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).

A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22).

Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential
1. When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp.
4. As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential.

Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.

Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential

Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?
Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts.

The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24).

Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata

Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis.

Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).

(b) Flaccid and plasmolysed plant cells

(a) Turgor pressure in the cells of the plant helps to keep this plant firm and upright.
(b) Loss of turgor due to excessive water loss may cause a plant to wilt.

16,How do the concentration gradient illustrated in Figure 2.3 and the surface area-to-volume ratio shown in Figure 2.7 together explain the efficiency of diffusion in cells of different sizes?,"['<1-hop>\n\nChapter 2 | Cells and the Chemistry of Life ### 2.1 What Is Diffusion? ####  Diffusion? #### Learning Outcomes - Define diffusion and describe its role in nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in plants and humans. - Describe the factors that affect the rate of diffusion. #### Diffusion Imagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room. Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place. [The image shows an illustration of two people in a living room. One person has spilled a bottle of perfume, and perfume particles are shown spreading throughout the room.] Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particles 1. Perfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions. 2. Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a gas. 3. The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly. 4. This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion. #### What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion? In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient. In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradient between A and B. Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two regions. The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3). ```mermaid graph LR A[point A] -->|concentration gradient| B[point B] C[area of high concentration of particles] --> D[direction of movement of particles] D --> E[particles spacing out] ``` Figure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house. - Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient. - The steeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A. The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down.

For example, cell B has more surface area than cell A but less surface area per unit volume, resulting in slower intake of food and oxygen per unit volume. Consequently, larger cells have a reduced rate of diffusion because the smaller surface area relative to their volume limits the amount of substances that can diffuse in or out efficiently. Together, these figures explain that while diffusion depends on the concentration gradient, the efficiency of diffusion in cells is also constrained by their surface area-to-volume ratio, with smaller cells diffusing substances more effectively due to a higher ratio.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The concentration gradient in Figure 2.3 shows that particles move from a place where there are many particles to where there are fewer particles, spreading out evenly. Figure 2.7 shows that smaller cells have a bigger surface area compared to their volume, so they can take in food and oxygen faster. Together, these ideas explain that small cells with a big surface area-to-volume ratio can absorb substances quickly because particles move easily down the concentration gradient across their cell membrane. Bigger cells have a smaller surface area compared to their volume, so diffusion is slower and less efficient for them.","Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
Content: ### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

### Let's Investigate 2.2
Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios
1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.
2. Complete Table 2.1.

From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

</tr>
</table>

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""
Person C: ""Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.""

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Summary: This unit introduces the concept of diffusion, explaining it as the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. It explores the role of diffusion in biological systems with examples such as perfume spreading in a room and gas exchange in living organisms. The unit also discusses important factors affecting the rate of diffusion: concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. Investigations demonstrate diffusion in liquids and how cell size and shape influence efficiency of diffusion. Adaptations like microvilli in epithelial cells illustrate how cells maximize surface area to optimize absorption. The unit closes with practical exercises and question prompts to consolidate understanding.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

Content: Imagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.

Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place.

[The image shows an illustration of two people in a living room. One person has spilled a bottle of perfume, and perfume particles are shown spreading throughout the room.]

Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particles

1. Perfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.
2. Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a gas.
3. The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.
4. This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.

What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion?

In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient.

In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradient between A and B.

Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two regions.

The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3).

In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.
- Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.
- The steeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.

Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.

Unit Title: 2.3 What Is Active Transport?
Section Title: What Is Active Transport?
Content: Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport.

Active transport is the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.

#### Where Does Active Transport Occur?
Active transport occurs only in living cells because living cells respire. It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.

In the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.

In plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution (Figure 2.31).

#### Let's Practise 2.2
1. Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brine or syrups are used in food preservation.
2. An animal cell is placed in a concentrated solution of sugar. Which substance will leave the cell and which will move into the cell? What processes are involved?

Unit Title: 2.3 What Is Active Transport?
Summary: This unit explains the concept of active transport, an energy-dependent biological process where substances move across cell membranes against their concentration gradient. It contrasts active transport with diffusion, highlighting that active transport requires energy from respiration and a living cell membrane, whereas diffusion does not. The unit discusses where active transport occurs, providing examples such as glucose uptake in human intestinal cells and mineral salt absorption in plant root hairs. Illustrations and tables support these explanations. Practice questions and a mapping activity further reinforce understanding. The unit concludes with related questions about nutrition and physiology, engaging learners in applying concepts to real-life contexts such as food preservation and athletic nutrition.

Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis. - When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

An enzyme is less active at low temperatures. At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low. 2. As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases. Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation. 3. This is the optimum temperature, where the enzyme is most active. For most human enzymes, the optimum temperature is about 40–45 °C. 4. Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction. The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules. 5. At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been denatured. Most enzymes are denatured. Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis. Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme's active site (Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme's active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst. ```mermaid graph LR A[folded protein with<br/>intact active site] --> B[denaturation] B --> C[denatured protein<br/>(active site is lost)] A --> D[substrate<br/>molecule] C --> E[substrate<br/>molecule] style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style D fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style E fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px ``` Figure 4.11 At temperatures above optimum, some enzymes are denatured.

This movement depends on the kinetic energy of water molecules, which influences their tendency to move. Similarly, Figure 4.10 shows that temperature affects enzyme activity by altering the kinetic energy of enzyme and substrate molecules. At low temperatures, molecules move slowly, resulting in fewer collisions and lower enzyme activity. As temperature increases, molecular movement speeds up, increasing the rate of effective collisions and enzyme-substrate complex formation until an optimum temperature is reached. Beyond this optimum, enzymes denature and activity decreases. Thus, both figures highlight how molecular movement, influenced by factors like concentration gradients and temperature, governs biological processes such as osmosis and enzyme reactions.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The water potential gradient in Figure 2.17 shows how water molecules move from a place with higher water potential to a place with lower water potential. This movement happens because molecules are always moving. In Figure 4.10, the effect of temperature on enzyme activity is explained by how temperature changes the movement of molecules. When temperature is low, molecules move slowly, so reactions happen slowly. When temperature increases, molecules move faster, so enzymes and substrates collide more often, making reactions faster. But if the temperature is too high, enzymes lose their shape and stop working. So, both figures show that the movement of molecules is important for how fast reactions happen.","Unit Title: 4.2 What Are the Characteristics of Enzymes?
Section Title: Characteristics of Enzymes
Content: ### Characteristics of Enzymes

#### Enzymes Speed Up Chemical Reactions
Enzymes alter the rates of chemical reactions that occur in a cell. Enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy needed to start the reaction.

#### Enzymes Are Specific in Action
Enzymes have active sites. Only substrates with a shape complementary to the active site can fit into the enzymes. When an enzyme binds to its substrate, it forms an enzyme–substrate complex. However, high temperature, acids and alkalis can affect the shape of an enzyme and consequently its function.

#### Enzymes Are Required in Minute Amounts and Remain Unchanged at the End of Reactions
Enzymes are very efficient molecules. Since they remain unchanged in the reactions they catalyse, the same enzyme molecules can be used over and over again. Thus, a small amount of an enzyme can catalyse the reaction for a large amount of substrate. For example, just a spoonful of washing powder containing enzymes is enough to wash a large load of clothing.

#### Enzymes Are Affected by Temperature
Figure 4.10 shows the effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction.

Figure 4.10 Effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction
1. An enzyme is less active at low temperatures.
   At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low.
2. As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.
   Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation.
3. This is the optimum temperature, where the enzyme is most active.
   For most human enzymes, the optimum temperature is about 40–45 6C.
4. Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction.
   The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules.
5. At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been denatured.
   Most enzymes are denatured.
Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis.
Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme's active site (Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme's active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst.

**Conclusion**
1. The less time taken to digest starch, the more active the enzyme is.
   In this investigation, enzyme activity is measured by calculating
   $\frac{1}{T}$ (the reciprocal of the time taken to digest starch). What can you
   conclude about the effect of temperature on the activity of amylase
   from the graph of $\frac{1}{T}$ against temperature?

### Enzymes Are Affected by pH

Enzymes are affected by the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions in which they act. Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease in the stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinal enzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary from the optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes.

In Figure 4.13, point M indicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH of about 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) or alkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, the enzyme is completely denatured.

Some COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at low temperatures for them to be effective. In some instances, the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as 	670 6C.
At this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that could break down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccine are literally frozen to a halt. Scientists and engineers thus need to design, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain such sub-arctic temperatures. They also need to design and construct containers that can store and transport large quantities of the vaccines across the world, from the place where it is manufactured to reach different countries.
These special freezers and containers are examples of technology in action. Engineers apply their knowledge in cooling systems to design and build machines that work to prevent enzymatic reactions on the vaccine ingredients during storage and transport (Figure 4.14).

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?
Content: The term 'water potential' is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.

When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

Tech Connect
In Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs.
The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.

Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment system

Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.

Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore?

Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:
- water potential gradient
- distance over which water molecules need to move
- surface area-to-volume ratio

Summary: This unit explores the characteristics and function of enzymes. It explains the enzyme specificity using the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis, describing how enzymes have active sites uniquely shaped for their substrates forming enzyme-substrate complexes. The unit details how enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy and remain unchanged after reactions, making them efficient catalysts required in minute amounts. It investigates the effects of temperature and pH on enzyme activity, showing optimum conditions for maximum activity and how extreme conditions cause denaturation, leading to the loss of enzyme function. The unit includes practical experiments to demonstrate temperature and pH effects on enzymes, discusses enzyme roles in biological systems, and connects these concepts to real-world applications like biological detergents and vaccine storage.

Unit Title: 3.3 What Are Proteins?
Section Title: Introduction to Enzymes
Content: ### Learning Outcome
- Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in all metabolic reactions.

### Biological Catalysts
Biological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.

> A catalyst is a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction.

For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.
potassium chlorate(VII) <strong>strong heat</strong> 12 potassium chloride + oxygen

When potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced. If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide:
- allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and
- speeds up the reaction.
At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst (Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boiling or by changes in the pH of the solution.

In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes.

### Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts
Enzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.
Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.

### Enzymes Lower Activation Energy
Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed.
The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.2 Activation energy is needed to start a chemical reaction.
1. Imagine a chemical reaction as the process of rolling a huge stone (reactant) up a hill so that it rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products).
2. Activation energy is the energy needed to roll the stone up the hill. Once over the hill, the rest of the reaction occurs. The stone rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products are formed).
Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the 'height' of the 'hill'. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.
For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 6C).

Unit Title: 4.2 What Are the Characteristics of Enzymes?
Section Title: How Does an Enzyme Work?
Content: Washing clothes in hot water is a traditional way of getting them very clean as the hot water helps in removing grease and dirt from soiled clothes. However, if you are using a biological washing detergent (Figure 4.7), which contains enzymes, it is recommended that you use lukewarm water instead of hot water. Why is this so? It is related to the nature of enzymes and how they function.

Figure 4.7 Enzyme-based biological detergent

Enzymes are highly specific in their action. For example, amylases only act on starch, and not on proteins or fats. Similarly, proteases act only on proteins, and lipases only on fats. This enzyme specificity means that each chemical reaction inside a cell is catalysed by a unique enzyme.

### Enzymes

An enzyme is specific in its action due to its three-dimensional shape. The 'lock-and-key' hypothesis explains how the shape of an enzyme affects the way it functions.

#### 'Lock-and-key' Hypothesis

The substances on which enzymes act are called substrates. For example, protein is the substrate on which a protease acts.

According to the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis, enzyme reactions depend on the presence of active sites (Figure 4.8). Active sites are grooves (depressions) or 'pockets' on the surface of an enzyme molecule into which the substrate molecule(s) with the matching shape can fit — just like a lock and key. The enzyme is the lock, and the substrate is the key.

**Disciplinary Idea**
**Structure and Function**
The structure of biological molecules affects their functions. For example, the structure of enzymes affects the substrates that can fit into the active site. This affects the reactions they catalyse.

Figure 4.8 Three-dimensional model of enzyme pepsin with its active site

When the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, an enzyme–substrate complex is formed. It is a temporary molecule formed when substrates bind to the enzyme. Reactions take place at the active site to convert the substrate molecule(s) into product molecule(s). The product molecule(s) separate(s) from the enzyme. The enzyme molecule remains unchanged and is free to combine again with more substrate molecules.

The general equation is: E + S ⇌ ES → E + P
where E = enzyme
      S = substrate(s)
      P = product(s).

The specific nature of an enzyme for its substrate is described in Figure 4.9.

Figure 4.9 The mode of action of an enzyme
1. An enzyme has a specific three-dimensional (3-D) shape. It has a depression called the active site. The substance on which the enzyme acts is called the substrate.
2. Only the substrate with a 3-D shape complementary to that of the active site can fit into the enzyme. This results in the formation of an enzyme–substrate complex. The enzyme is just like a lock and the substrate a key. The substrate fits into the enzyme just like a key fits into a lock. This is called the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis.
3. While the substrate is attached to the active site, a chemical reaction occurs. The substrate is converted to the products.
4. Later, the products leave the active site. The enzyme remains unchanged. It can catalyse another reaction.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion
Content: Imagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.

Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place.

[The image shows an illustration of two people in a living room. One person has spilled a bottle of perfume, and perfume particles are shown spreading throughout the room.]

Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particles

1. Perfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.
2. Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a gas.
3. The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.
4. This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.

What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion?

In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient.

In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradient between A and B.

Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two regions.

The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3).

Figure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion

Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out

In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.
- Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.
- The steeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.

Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.

   At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low.
2. As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.

**Conclusion**
1. The less time taken to digest starch, the more active the enzyme is.
   In this investigation, enzyme activity is measured by calculating
   $\frac{1}{T}$ (the reciprocal of the time taken to digest starch). What can you
   conclude about the effect of temperature on the activity of amylase
   from the graph of $\frac{1}{T}$ against temperature?

### Enzymes Are Affected by pH

Enzymes are affected by the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions in which they act. Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease in the stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinal enzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary from the optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes.

In Figure 4.13, point M indicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH of about 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) or alkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, the enzyme is completely denatured.

### Tech Connect

Some COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at low temperatures for them to be effective. In some instances, the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as 	670 6C.
At this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that could break down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccine are literally frozen to a halt. Scientists and engineers thus need to design, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain such sub-arctic temperatures. They also need to design and construct containers that can store and transport large quantities of the vaccines across the world, from the place where it is manufactured to reach different countries.
These special freezers and containers are examples of technology in action. Engineers apply their knowledge in cooling systems to design and build machines that work to prevent enzymatic reactions on the vaccine ingredients during storage and transport (Figure 4.14).

Unit Title: 4.2 What Are the Characteristics of Enzymes?
Summary: This unit explores the characteristics and function of enzymes. It explains the enzyme specificity using the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis, describing how enzymes have active sites uniquely shaped for their substrates forming enzyme-substrate complexes. The unit details how enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy and remain unchanged after reactions, making them efficient catalysts required in minute amounts. It investigates the effects of temperature and pH on enzyme activity, showing optimum conditions for maximum activity and how extreme conditions cause denaturation, leading to the loss of enzyme function. The unit includes practical experiments to demonstrate temperature and pH effects on enzymes, discusses enzyme roles in biological systems, and connects these concepts to real-world applications like biological detergents and vaccine storage.

- Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in all metabolic reactions.

### Biological Catalysts
Biological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.

> A catalyst is a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction.

For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.
potassium chlorate(VII) <strong>strong heat</strong> 12 potassium chloride + oxygen

When potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced. If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide:
- allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and
- speeds up the reaction.
At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst (Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boiling or by changes in the pH of the solution.

In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes.

### Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts
Enzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.
Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.

### Enzymes Lower Activation Energy
Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed.
The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.2 Activation energy is needed to start a chemical reaction.
1. Imagine a chemical reaction as the process of rolling a huge stone (reactant) up a hill so that it rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products).
2. Activation energy is the energy needed to roll the stone up the hill. Once over the hill, the rest of the reaction occurs. The stone rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products are formed).
Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the 'height' of the 'hill'. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.
For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 6C).

Unit Title: 4.2 What Are the Characteristics of Enzymes?
Section Title: How Does an Enzyme Work?
Content: Washing clothes in hot water is a traditional way of getting them very clean as the hot water helps in removing grease and dirt from soiled clothes. However, if you are using a biological washing detergent (Figure 4.7), which contains enzymes, it is recommended that you use lukewarm water instead of hot water. Why is this so? It is related to the nature of enzymes and how they function.

Figure 4.7 Enzyme-based biological detergent

Enzymes are highly specific in their action. For example, amylases only act on starch, and not on proteins or fats. Similarly, proteases act only on proteins, and lipases only on fats. This enzyme specificity means that each chemical reaction inside a cell is catalysed by a unique enzyme.

### Enzymes

An enzyme is specific in its action due to its three-dimensional shape. The 'lock-and-key' hypothesis explains how the shape of an enzyme affects the way it functions.

#### 'Lock-and-key' Hypothesis

The substances on which enzymes act are called substrates. For example, protein is the substrate on which a protease acts.

According to the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis, enzyme reactions depend on the presence of active sites (Figure 4.8). Active sites are grooves (depressions) or 'pockets' on the surface of an enzyme molecule into which the substrate molecule(s) with the matching shape can fit — just like a lock and key. The enzyme is the lock, and the substrate is the key.

**Disciplinary Idea**
**Structure and Function**
The structure of biological molecules affects their functions. For example, the structure of enzymes affects the substrates that can fit into the active site. This affects the reactions they catalyse.

Figure 4.8 Three-dimensional model of enzyme pepsin with its active site

When the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, an enzyme–substrate complex is formed. It is a temporary molecule formed when substrates bind to the enzyme. Reactions take place at the active site to convert the substrate molecule(s) into product molecule(s). The product molecule(s) separate(s) from the enzyme. The enzyme molecule remains unchanged and is free to combine again with more substrate molecules.

The general equation is: E + S ⇌ ES → E + P
where E = enzyme
      S = substrate(s)
      P = product(s).

The specific nature of an enzyme for its substrate is described in Figure 4.9.

Figure 4.9 The mode of action of an enzyme
1. An enzyme has a specific three-dimensional (3-D) shape. It has a depression called the active site. The substance on which the enzyme acts is called the substrate.
2. Only the substrate with a 3-D shape complementary to that of the active site can fit into the enzyme. This results in the formation of an enzyme–substrate complex. The enzyme is just like a lock and the substrate a key. The substrate fits into the enzyme just like a key fits into a lock. This is called the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis.
3. While the substrate is attached to the active site, a chemical reaction occurs. The substrate is converted to the products.
4. Later, the products leave the active site. The enzyme remains unchanged. It can catalyse another reaction.

Learning Outcomes - Define osmosis, investigate and describe the effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues. - Discuss the factors that affect the rate of osmosis. #### Osmosis The cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar. Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis (a) Initial set-up: - 10% sucrose solution (more solute molecules per unit volume) in arm A - 5% sucrose solution (fewer solute molecules per unit volume) in arm B - Partially permeable membrane separating the two arms - Water molecules and sucrose molecules shown (b) After osmosis: - Rise in level of solution in arm A - Drop in level due to movement of water molecules to A in arm B - Partially permeable membrane still in place Compared to arm B, arm A contains: - More sucrose molecules per unit volume - Fewer water molecules per unit volume After some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls. What do you think has happened? - Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane. - Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume. Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume). The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. #### Let's Investigate 2.4 Aim: To demonstrate osmosis Procedure: 1. Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing. 2. Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water. 3. Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled. 4. Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube. 5. Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube. 6. After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment.

Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room. Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place. [The image shows an illustration of two people in a living room. One person has spilled a bottle of perfume, and perfume particles are shown spreading throughout the room.] Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particles 1. Perfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions. 2. Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a gas. 3. The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly. 4. This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion. #### What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion? In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient. In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradient between A and B. Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two regions. The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3). ```mermaid graph LR A[point A] -->|concentration gradient| B[point B] C[area of high concentration of particles] --> D[direction of movement of particles] D --> E[particles spacing out] ``` Figure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house. - Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient. - The steeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance. Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient. ####']","Figure 2.1 illustrates diffusion using the example of perfume particles spreading through a living room. Diffusion is described as the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, moving down a concentration gradient. The particles have kinetic energy and move randomly, causing them to spread out until evenly spaced. The steeper the concentration gradient, the faster the diffusion rate. Figure 2.15 demonstrates osmosis, which is the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane that allows water but not larger molecules like sucrose to pass through. In the experiment, water moves from the arm with fewer solute molecules (higher water concentration) to the arm with more solute molecules (lower water concentration), equalizing solute concentrations on both sides. Both diffusion and osmosis rely on concentration gradients to drive the movement of molecules, with diffusion involving the movement of solute particles and osmosis specifically involving the movement of water molecules across membranes.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"Figure 2.1 shows diffusion where perfume particles move from a place with many particles (high concentration) to a place with fewer particles (low concentration). This movement happens because particles like to spread out evenly, moving down the concentration gradient.

Figure 2.15 shows osmosis, which is a special kind of diffusion for water. Water moves through a partially permeable membrane from a place with more water (higher water potential) to a place with less water (lower water potential). The membrane lets water through but not bigger molecules like sugar.

In both diffusion and osmosis, concentration gradients are very important. They are the difference in concentration between two areas. Particles move from where there are more particles to where there are fewer until things are balanced. This is how molecules move across membranes to keep cells working well.","Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Summary: This unit introduces the concept of diffusion, explaining it as the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. It explores the role of diffusion in biological systems with examples such as perfume spreading in a room and gas exchange in living organisms. The unit also discusses important factors affecting the rate of diffusion: concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. Investigations demonstrate diffusion in liquids and how cell size and shape influence efficiency of diffusion. Adaptations like microvilli in epithelial cells illustrate how cells maximize surface area to optimize absorption. The unit closes with practical exercises and question prompts to consolidate understanding.

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Summary: This unit explores the concept of osmosis, its definition, and its effects on plant and animal tissues. It introduces osmosis as the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane and describes key experiments that demonstrate osmosis using sucrose solutions and dialysis tubing. The unit explains water potential and its role in osmosis, how water potential gradients drive the movement of water molecules from dilute to concentrated solutions, and presents the significance of turgor pressure in maintaining plant structure and function. It discusses how cells respond to solutions of varying water potential—becoming turgid, flaccid, or plasmolysed in plant cells and swelling or crenating in animal cells. The practical applications are illustrated via NEWater's reverse osmosis technology. Several investigations involving potato strips, scapes, and spinach stems are included to exemplify osmosis in living tissues. Additionally, the differences between diffusion and osmosis are summarized, providing a comprehensive understanding of this vital biological process.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

Unit Title: 2.3 What Is Active Transport?
Summary: This unit explains the concept of active transport, an energy-dependent biological process where substances move across cell membranes against their concentration gradient. It contrasts active transport with diffusion, highlighting that active transport requires energy from respiration and a living cell membrane, whereas diffusion does not. The unit discusses where active transport occurs, providing examples such as glucose uptake in human intestinal cells and mineral salt absorption in plant root hairs. Illustrations and tables support these explanations. Practice questions and a mapping activity further reinforce understanding. The unit concludes with related questions about nutrition and physiology, engaging learners in applying concepts to real-life contexts such as food preservation and athletic nutrition.

Unit Title: 2.3 What Is Active Transport?
Section Title: What Is Active Transport?
Content: Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport.

Active transport is the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.

Table 2.3 Differences between diffusion and active transport

#### Where Does Active Transport Occur?
Active transport occurs only in living cells because living cells respire. It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.

In the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.

In plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution (Figure 2.31).

#### Let's Practise 2.2
1. Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brine or syrups are used in food preservation.
2. An animal cell is placed in a concentrated solution of sugar. Which substance will leave the cell and which will move into the cell? What processes are involved?

#### Let's Practise 2.3

How can we show osmosis in living tissues (potato)?
Potato strips are commonly used in experiments to show osmosis in living tissues. The dimensions of the strips used are shown in Figure 2.27. For instructions on how to set up this experiment, refer to Experiment 2C of the Practical Workbook.
If the potato strips decrease in length, does this relate to water molecules leaving the strips? How can this experiment be extended to estimate the concentration of cell sap in the cell?

Let's Investigate 2.6
How can we show osmosis in living tissues (scape)?
A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.
One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)).

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: Osmosis
Content: The cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar.

Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis

(a) Initial set-up:
- 10% sucrose solution (more solute molecules per unit volume) in arm A
- 5% sucrose solution (fewer solute molecules per unit volume) in arm B
- Partially permeable membrane separating the two arms
- Water molecules and sucrose molecules shown

(b) After osmosis:
- Rise in level of solution in arm A
- Drop in level due to movement of water molecules to A in arm B
- Partially permeable membrane still in place

Compared to arm B, arm A contains:
- More sucrose molecules per unit volume
- Fewer water molecules per unit volume

After some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.

What do you think has happened?
- Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane.
- Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.

Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).

The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis.

Let's Investigate 2.4
Aim: To demonstrate osmosis
Procedure:
1. Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.
2. Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.
3. Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled.
4. Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.
5. Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube.
6. After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment.

Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell? The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive. The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it. The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nChapter 2 | Cells and the Chemistry of Life ### Movement of Substances Figure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient ```mermaid graph TD A[direction of movement of water molecules] --> B[water potential gradient] C[dilute solution] --> D[concentrated solution] ``` #### Tech Connect In Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis. Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment system Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained. Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as: - water potential gradient - distance over which water molecules need to move - surface area-to-volume ratio ### How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms? A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances. Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells. ### What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell). A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential 1.

The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. Link: Human cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potential ###']","The surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell is crucial because it determines the rate at which materials such as oxygen, nutrients, and waste move across the cell membrane. A higher surface area-to-volume ratio allows for a faster rate of diffusion, enabling the cell to efficiently exchange substances necessary for survival. This concept is directly related to osmosis, which is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential through a partially permeable membrane. In plant cells, when placed in a solution with higher water potential, water enters the cell by osmosis, causing the cell to swell and become turgid due to the inelastic cell wall that prevents bursting. The vacuole enlarges, pushing the cytoplasm against the cell wall, creating turgor pressure that supports the plant. In contrast, animal cells lack a cell wall, so when placed in a solution with higher water potential, they swell and may burst because they are not protected by a rigid structure. Thus, the surface area-to-volume ratio affects how quickly substances move in and out of cells, and osmosis demonstrates how cells respond differently to water potential changes based on their structural differences.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell affects how fast substances like water and nutrients can move across the cell membrane. A higher surface area-to-volume ratio means substances can move in and out more quickly. This is important for osmosis, where water moves across the cell membrane from a place with higher water potential to lower water potential. Plant cells have a cell wall that helps them swell and stay firm (turgid) when water enters, while animal cells can swell and even burst because they don't have a cell wall. So, the surface area-to-volume ratio helps cells absorb water efficiently, and the cell wall in plants protects them during osmosis in solutions with higher water potential.","Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?

When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).

A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?
Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.

Disciplinary Idea
Homeostasis, Co-ordination and Response
Through the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water Potential?
When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).

A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22).

Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential
1. When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell.
2. By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.
3. The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp.
4. As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential.

Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.

Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential

Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?
Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts.

The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24).

Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata

Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis.

Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Summary: This unit explores the concept of osmosis, its definition, and its effects on plant and animal tissues. It introduces osmosis as the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane and describes key experiments that demonstrate osmosis using sucrose solutions and dialysis tubing. The unit explains water potential and its role in osmosis, how water potential gradients drive the movement of water molecules from dilute to concentrated solutions, and presents the significance of turgor pressure in maintaining plant structure and function. It discusses how cells respond to solutions of varying water potential—becoming turgid, flaccid, or plasmolysed in plant cells and swelling or crenating in animal cells. The practical applications are illustrated via NEWater's reverse osmosis technology. Several investigations involving potato strips, scapes, and spinach stems are included to exemplify osmosis in living tissues. Additionally, the differences between diffusion and osmosis are summarized, providing a comprehensive understanding of this vital biological process.

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
Content: ### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio
What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?
Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

### Let's Investigate 2.2
Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios
1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.
2. Complete Table 2.1.

<table>
<caption>Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizes</caption>

    <th>Cube<br>sides 3 cm</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface area</td>
    <td>Area of one face<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm²<br>Surface area<br>= number of faces ×<br>area of one face<br>= 6 × 1 cm²<br>= 6 cm²</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Volume</td>
    <td>Volume<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Surface<br>area-to-<br>volume ratio</td>
    <td>6 cm² : 1 cm³</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

Let's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.

The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.

<tr>
<td>This cell can obtain food and oxygen from all its sides.</td>
<td>Portion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A.</td>
<td>Portion Z has an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?
Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

![Figure 2.8 Models to explain how cells of the same volume can have different surface areas]

<table>
<tr>
<th>Cell A</th>
<th>Cell B</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cell A: Surface area = 6 cm²<br>Volume = 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
<td>Cell B: Surface area = 10 cm²<br>Volume = 2 cm × 2 cm × 0.25 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>
</tr>
</table>

Notice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.

#### Word Alert
Optimum: best or most favourable

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine

### Let's Investigate 2.3
**Aim**
To investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption

**Procedure**
1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.
2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.
3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.

Figure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area

### Movement of Substances
**Observation and Discussion**
1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?
2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

Figure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.
Person A: ""Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.""
Person B: ""The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.""

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?
Content: The term 'water potential' is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.

When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

Figure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container

- Left side: more solute; lower water potential
- Right side: less solute, higher water potential
- Partially permeable membrane in the middle
- Water potential gradient established
- Water molecules move down a water potential gradient through a partially permeable membrane

Figure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis.
Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane.

Tech Connect
In Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs.
The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.

Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment system

Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.

Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore?

Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:
- water potential gradient
- distance over which water molecules need to move
- surface area-to-volume ratio

Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: Investigations Demonstrating Osmosis in Living Tissues
Content: Let's Investigate 2.5
How can we show osmosis in living tissues (potato)?
Potato strips are commonly used in experiments to show osmosis in living tissues. The dimensions of the strips used are shown in Figure 2.27. For instructions on how to set up this experiment, refer to Experiment 2C of the Practical Workbook.
If the potato strips decrease in length, does this relate to water molecules leaving the strips? How can this experiment be extended to estimate the concentration of cell sap in the cell?

Let's Investigate 2.6
How can we show osmosis in living tissues (scape)?
A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.
One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)).

Unit Title: 2.1 What Is Diffusion?
Section Title: Diffusion Across a Membrane
Content: Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.

As a result:
• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion
The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:
• concentration gradient
• diffusion distance  
• surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

#### Diffusion Distance
The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

================
Unit Title: 2.2 What Is Osmosis?
Section Title: Osmosis
Content: The cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar.

Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis

(a) Initial set-up:
- 10% sucrose solution (more solute molecules per unit volume) in arm A
- 5% sucrose solution (fewer solute molecules per unit volume) in arm B
- Partially permeable membrane separating the two arms
- Water molecules and sucrose molecules shown

(b) After osmosis:
- Rise in level of solution in arm A
- Drop in level due to movement of water molecules to A in arm B
- Partially permeable membrane still in place

Compared to arm B, arm A contains:
- More sucrose molecules per unit volume
- Fewer water molecules per unit volume

After some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.

What do you think has happened?
- Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane.
- Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.

Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).

The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis.

Let's Investigate 2.4
Aim: To demonstrate osmosis
Procedure:
1. Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.
2. Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.
3. Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled.
4. Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.
5. Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube.
6. After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment.
