Cells are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of life.\nWhat do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:\n- A cell takes in raw materials.\n- Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.\n- These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the body.\nIn any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body.\n#### How Did Cells Get Their Name?\nThe term 'cells' was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667. He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the bark of a tree (Figure 1.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the boxes 'cells', just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.\n![Figure 1.1 Robert Hooke observed that cork is made up of tiny cells.]\n### How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?\nMost cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!\n- Light microscopes magnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)).\n- Electron microscopes magnify objects to more than 200 000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times) (Figure 1.2(b)).\nA camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.\n- Light micrographs can come out as colour images.\n- Electron micrographs are black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.\nTo get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).\n![Figure 1.2 Microscopes]\n![Figure 1.3 We may cut a cell in two different ways in order to view cell structures from different angles. This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.]\n### What Does a Cell Consist Of?\nA cell is a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.\nWhile all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm (Greek: protos = first; plasm = form).\nProtoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities that allow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.\npage_number: 1",

While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life.\n</div>\nThe protoplasm of a cell is made up of three parts: the cell membrane (also known as cell surface membrane), cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 1.4).\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n[A diagram of a generalized animal cell showing major organelles, including cell membrane, ribosome, vacuole, nucleus, chromosome, nuclear membrane, and cytoplasm]\nFigure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles\n</div>\n### Cell Membrane\nThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipids and proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell.\n### Cell Wall\nA plant cell also has a cell wall that encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n[A diagram of a generalized plant cell showing cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, ribosome, mitochondrion, vacuole, and chloroplast]\nFigure 1.5 A generalised plant cell\n</div>\n<div style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px; padding: 10px; background-color: #f0f0f0; border: 1px solid #ccc;\">\n<strong>Word Alert</strong><br>\nMitochondrion: singular for mitochondria<br>\nLipids: biological molecules that are not soluble in water.

Organelles inside the cell are also enclosed by their own membranes.\n</div>\n### Cytoplasm\nThe cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the cell and is enclosed by the cell membrane. It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains organelles. An organelle is a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.\nOrganelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body and ribosomes are not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope.\n### What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?\nThe cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelle is specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n[A diagram of an animal cell seen under an electron microscope, showing cell membrane, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion, nucleus, vacuole, Golgi body, vesicle, free ribosome, and cytoplasm]\nFigure 1.6 Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscope\n</div>\n### Nucleus\nThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section.\nThese are the functions of the nucleus:\n• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.\n• It is essential for cell division. Cells without a nucleus, like the red blood cells of a mammal, are unable to divide.\npage_number: 2",

    "md": "# Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of Life\n## Cell Structure and Organisation\nTo see the individual parts of the nucleus clearly, we will need to use an electron microscope (Figure 1.7).\n### Chromosomes\n- Each chromosome is a long thread-like structure found within the nucleus. (A human cell contains 46 chromosomes.)\n- It is made up of proteins and a compound called deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. Hereditary information is stored in DNA. DNA carries instructions that a cell needs for carrying out its activities.\n- When the cell is dividing, the chromosomes condense and shorten to become thick, rod-shaped structures.\nFigure 1.8 shows the appearance of chromosomes during cell division.\n### Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum\nRough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) consists of a network of flattened spaces lined with a membrane (Figure 1.9). (Greek: endoplasm = within the cytoplasm; reticulum = network).\n- Its surface appears rough when viewed under the electron microscope. This is because small particles called ribosomes are attached to its outer surface (Figure 1.10).\n- The outer surface of the RER is continuous with the nuclear membrane.\n### Ribosomes\nRibosomes are small round structures. They are either attached to the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) or lie freely in the cytoplasm (Figure 1.6 on page 5). They are needed to synthesise proteins in the cell.\n- The ribosomes attached to the RER make proteins that are usually transported out of the cell.\n- The ribosomes lying freely in the cytoplasm make proteins that are used within the cytoplasm of that cell.\nThe RER transports proteins made by ribosomes to the Golgi body for secretion out of the cell.\n### Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum\nSmooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) does not have ribosomes attached to its membrane. SER is more tubular than RER (see Figure 1.11). It is connected to the RER.\nThe SER:\n- synthesises substances such as fats and steroids (sex hormones in mammals are steroids)\n- converts harmful substances into harmless substances through a process known as detoxification\n### Golgi body\nThe Golgi body (also known as Golgi apparatus) is shaped like a disc. It consists of a stack of flattened spaces surrounded by membranes. Vesicles (tiny spherical spaces enclosed by a membrane) can be seen fusing with one side of the Golgi body and pinching off from the opposite side (Figure 1.12).\nThe Golgi body:\n- chemically modifies substances made by the ER\n- stores and packages these substances in vesicles for secretion out of the cell\nChapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of Life\nCell Structure and Organisation | Chapter 1\npage_number: 3",

Vesicles transport substances within the cell. Small vesicles containing substances made by the ER are pinched off from the ER.\n2. These vesicles then fuse with the Golgi body and release their contents into the Golgi body. The substances made by the ER may be modified inside the Golgi body.\n3. Secretory vesicles containing these modified substances are pinched off from the Golgi body. They then move to the cell membrane.\n4. The secretory vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and their contents are released out of the cell.\nFigure 1.13 How substances made by the endoplasmic reticulum enter the Golgi body and are finally secreted out of the cell\n[The image shows a diagram of the process described above, with rough endoplasmic reticulum, vesicle forming, Golgi body, and substances being released out of the cell.]\nCompare the general structure of the plant cell (Figure 1.15(a)) with that of the animal cell (Figure 1.15(b)).

Aerobic respiration occurs in the mitochondria. During aerobic respiration, food substances are broken down to release energy (see Chapter 7). This energy may be used by the cell to perform cell activities such as growth and reproduction.\nFigure 1.14 Mitochondrion\n[The image shows a detailed view of a mitochondrion with membrane folds and a half section of a mitochondrion]\n#### Chloroplasts\n- Chloroplasts are oval structures found in plant cells (Figure 1.16).\n- Chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll.\n- Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants make food (see Chapter 12).\nFigure 1.16 Chloroplast\n(a) Three-dimensional diagram of a chloroplast\n(b) Colourised electron micrograph of a section of a chloroplast\n#### Vacuoles\nA vacuole is a fluid-filled space enclosed by a partially permeable membrane. Vacuoles store substances within the cell.\nPlant cells have a large central vacuole which contains a liquid called cell sap. Cell sap contains dissolved substances such as sugars, mineral salts and amino acids.\nAnimal cells have many small vacuoles that contain water and food substances. These vacuoles usually exist temporarily.\n[The image shows a stack of membranes containing chlorophyll]\npage_number: 4",

Place a drop of methylene blue on a clean microscope slide.\n2. Gently scrape the inside of your cheek with a blunt end of a clean toothpick. Swirl the toothpick end in the drop of methylene blue.\n3. Carefully lower a cover slip at an angle over the slide.\n4. Examine the cells on the slide under a light microscope.\n5. Draw one cheek cell and label it as fully as you can.\n**Observation**\nFigure 1.17 shows human cheek cells viewed under the light microscope.\n**Discussion**\n1. Compare your drawing with the diagram of an animal cell in Figure 1.4 on page 4. Which structures shown in Figure 1.4 are not visible under the light microscope?\n2. Why must the cover slip be lowered at an angle in step 3?\nFigure 1.17\nFigure 1.17: Image showing a human cheek cell with labeled parts: cell membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasm.\n### Let's Investigate 1.2\n**Aim**\nTo examine plant cells using a light microscope\n**Procedure**\n1. Take a fleshy scale leaf from an onion bulb and bend the leaf until it breaks into two. Gently peel off the skin, called the epidermis, from the inner surface of the leaf using a pair of forceps.\n2. Place the epidermis on a clean glass slide.\n3. Add a drop of iodine solution (or methylene blue) in the middle of the slide. Carefully lower a coverslip at an angle over the slide.\n4. Examine the epidermis under the microscope.\n5. Draw one epidermal cell and label it as fully as you can.\n**Observation**\nFigure 1.18 shows onion epidermal cells viewed under the light microscope.\n**Discussion**\n1. How does this cell differ from the plant cell in Figure 1.5 on page 4?\n2. State two differences between plant and animal cells that are visible under the light microscope.\n   *Hint: Look at shape and cell structures.*\nFigure 1.18\nFigure 1.18: Image showing an onion epidermal cell with labeled parts: nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell wall.\n### Differences Between Plant and Animal Cells\nTable 1.1 shows the key differences between plant and animal cells.\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Plant Cell</th>\n      <th>Animal Cell</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Cell wall present</td>\n      <td>Cell wall absent</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Presence of a large, central vacuole</td>\n      <td>Presence of many small vacuoles</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Chloroplasts present</td>\n      <td>Chloroplasts absent</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nFigure 1.19\nFigure 1.19: Blood contains red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma.\nFigure 1.20\nFigure 1.20: Plants contain xylem and phloem tissues that work together for a specific function.\nAn organ consists of more than one kind of tissue, all working together to perform a specific function. Examples of organs are the stomach and leaf.\nAn organ system consists of several organs working together for a common purpose. Examples of organ systems in humans include the digestive system, circulatory system, respiratory system and transport system. In plants, examples of organ systems include the root system and the shoot system. Various systems together make up the entire body of an organism.\n#### Helpful Note\nMethylene blue is a dye that stains structures in a sample, making parts of the cell more visible.\n#### Helpful Note\nA tissue is a group of cells with similar structures which work together to perform a specific function. There are two types of tissues: simple tissue and complex tissue. An example of simple tissue is the muscular tissue. Complex tissues contain more than one type of cells, e.g. blood (Figure 1.19) and xylem (Figure 1.20).\n#### Disciplinary Idea\n**The Cell**\nCells are the basic units of life. The different organelles of a typical plant and animal cell carry out specific cellular processes. The differences in organelles found in plant and animal cells can explain the differences in functions between plants and animals.\n#### Link\nPractical Workbook\npage_number: 5",

This ability is called cellular totipotency. Plant tissue culture scientists make use of this ability to develop plants in the laboratories from plant tissue culture (Figure 1.22). This method reduces the time to produce new varieties, as compared to traditional breeding methods.\nPlant tissue culture has far-reaching applications, especially in agriculture. Specific breeds of plants that are resistant to diseases can now be produced in large numbers. In forestry, this technique is useful for large scale propagation of forest trees.\nHow do you think this technique can help our environment and improve the lives of people in less developed countries?\nFigure 1.22 Scientist cutting plant tissue culture in a Petri dish\n### Word Alert\nPropagation: growing and planting new trees\nLet's explore some ideas about cells (Figure 1.23). Are all cells in an organism the same? Which student is correct?\nFigure 1.23 Three students are giving their views on cells. Which student is correct?\n### Tech Connect\nWe can now create chicken meat from chicken muscle cells cultured in the laboratory (Figure 1.24). Would this mean that we can produce a functioning organ in the laboratory by using cells that form the particular organ?\nScientists may be able to make a three-dimensional model of an organ in the laboratory. However, many natural biological reactions taking place in an organ system cannot be reproduced in a model. Tissue engineers can now study a variety of natural biological reactions in an organ by placing the respective cells on a microchip. A simplified model for study is created in this way.\nThese do not look anywhere near how our natural organs may look, but they are functional and they enable scientists to study the processes that take place in each organ, with almost complete control within the laboratory.\nFind out more about the benefits of using models to study processes in the human body.\nFigure 1.24 Meat cultured in the laboratory from stem cells\n### Past to Present\nFor many years, scientists and doctors have been injecting healthy blood stem cells into patients who suffer from leukaemia, a type of cancer of the blood. This method, known as bone marrow transplant, has been a highly effective treatment, increasing the survival rates of patients substantially.\nIn recent years, scientists have developed several other methods of using cells to treat different diseases. These methods use a special type of cell called stem cells. Stem cells, unlike other cells in the body, are not specialised cells and thus have the ability to develop into other specialised cell types (Figure 1.25). This opens up a whole range of possibilities. Cells of different organs can be potentially grown in the laboratory and transplanted into the organs of humans. A patient's immune cells could be modified to recognise cancerous cells in the lymph nodes and destroy them.\nThere are still a lot of challenges that scientists need to overcome. In the near future, we may be able to make use of cells to treat diseases that were once considered untreatable.\nFigure 1.25 Human stem cells can be used to develop a variety of cells.\npage_number: 7",

Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.\nFigure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place.\n[The image shows an illustration of two people in a living room. One person has spilled a bottle of perfume, and perfume particles are shown spreading throughout the room.]\nFigure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particles\n1. Perfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.\n2. Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a gas.\n3. The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.\n4. This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.\n#### What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion?\nIn Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient.\nIn Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradient between A and B.\nConcentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two regions.\nThe particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3).\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[point A] -->|concentration gradient| B[point B]\n    C[area of high concentration of particles] --> D[direction of movement of particles]\n    D --> E[particles spacing out]\n```\nFigure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion\nFigure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out\nIn Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.\n- Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.\n- The steeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.\nDiffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.\n#### Let's Investigate 2.1\n**Aim**\nTo investigate the diffusion of a dissolved substance in water\n**Procedure**\n1. Drop a copper(II) sulfate crystal into a gas jar full of water as shown in Figure 2.4. Cover the jar and allow it to stand for a few days.\n2. Observe the changes in the colour of the water.\n[The image shows a diagram of a gas jar filled with water. A copper(II) sulfate crystal is at the bottom of the jar.]\nFigure 2.4 Experimental set-up to demonstrate diffusion\nMovement of Substances | Chapter 2\npage_number: 10",

    "md": "### Diffusion Across a Membrane\nFigure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.\nAs a result:\n• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.\n• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.\nEventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.\nFigure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane\n### Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion\nThe rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:\n• concentration gradient\n• diffusion distance  \n• surface area-to-volume ratio\nHow concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.\n#### Diffusion Distance\nThe time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.\nIn living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.\nExchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.\nFigure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion\nSolutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.\nChapter 2 | Cells and the Chemistry of Life\nMovement of Substances | Chapter 2\npage_number: 11",

The rate of intake\n                                       The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the           of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.\n                                       cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell           The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing.

This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food                                      favourable\n                                       membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with     intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.\n                                       the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion.

    "md": "## Cells and the Chemistry of Life\n### Surface Area-to-volume Ratio\nWhat does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?\nWhy are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?\nThe answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.\nThe rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.\nThe following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.\n### Let's Investigate 2.2\nCalculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios\n1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.\n2. Complete Table 2.1.\n<table>\n<caption>Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizes</caption>\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>Cube<br>sides 1 cm</th>\n    <th>Cube<br>sides 2 cm</th>\n    <th>Cube<br>sides 3 cm</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Surface area</td>\n    <td>Area of one face<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm²<br>Surface area<br>= number of faces ×<br>area of one face<br>= 6 × 1 cm²<br>= 6 cm²</td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Volume</td>\n    <td>Volume<br>= 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Surface<br>area-to-<br>volume ratio</td>\n    <td>6 cm² : 1 cm³</td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nFrom our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.\nLet's explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.\nIn Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A.\nThe cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimum size. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big.\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Each shaded square represents the surface area of a unit volume of protoplasm.</td>\n<td>food and oxygen in</td>\n<td>waste products out</td>\n<td>imaginary lines</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n![Figure 2.7 Models to explain what surface area-to-volume ratio means to a cell of increasing size]\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Cell A with sides of 1 cm</th>\n<th>Cell B with sides of 2 cm</th>\n<th>Cell C with sides of 3 cm</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>This cell can obtain food and oxygen from all its sides.</td>\n<td>Portion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A.</td>\n<td>Portion Z has an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n### How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?\nConsider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?\n![Figure 2.8 Models to explain how cells of the same volume can have different surface areas]\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Cell A</th>\n<th>Cell B</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cell A: Surface area = 6 cm²<br>Volume = 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>\n<td>Cell B: Surface area = 10 cm²<br>Volume = 2 cm × 2 cm × 0.25 cm<br>= 1 cm³</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\nNotice that the rectangular cell B has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.\n#### Word Alert\nOptimum: best or most favourable\nChapter 2 | Cells and the Chemistry of Life\nMovement of Substances | Chapter 2\npage_number: 12",

    "md": "## Cells and the Chemistry of Life\nSome cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.\nFigure 2.9 Microvilli on the epithelial cells of the small intestine\n### Let's Investigate 2.3\n**Aim**\nTo investigate the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and absorption\n**Procedure**\n1. Use a knife and cut out three blocks of agar (stained with bromothymol blue) with the dimensions (in cm) shown in Figure 2.10.\n2. Completely immerse the three agar blocks in dilute hydrochloric acid and note the time.\n3. As the acid diffuses into the blocks, the blocks gradually turn from blue to yellow. Examine the blocks regularly. Record how long it takes for each block to turn completely yellow.\nFigure 2.10 Three agar blocks with the same volume but different surface area\n### Movement of Substances\n**Observation and Discussion**\n1. What can you say about the relationship between surface area-to-volume ratio and the rate of absorption of the acid?\n2. How can you relate the shape of the agar blocks to cells in the body?\nNow, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.\nFigure 2.11 Three persons are discussing the movement of molecules. Comment on their statements.\nPerson A: \"Only the water molecules will move as they have enough energy.\"\nPerson B: \"The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water.\"\nPerson C: \"Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.\"\n**Hint:**\n- Why is the colour of the tea darker in the region nearer to the tea bag when the tea bag is first placed in the water?\n- What will the colour of the tea be after one hour?\n### Let's Practise 2.1\n1. (a) What is a concentration gradient?\n   (b) Define the term diffusion. What factor(s) affect the rate of diffusion?\n2. Explain why actively growing cells are usually small in size. Why do cells not grow beyond a certain size?\n3. (a) How are the root hair cell (Figure 2.12), the epithelial cell of the small intestine (Figure 2.13) and the red blood cell (Figure 2.14) adapted for absorption of materials?\nFigure 2.12 Root hair cell, Figure 2.13 Epithelial cell, Figure 2.14 Red blood cell\n(b) What feature(s) do the three cells have in common?\npage_number: 27\npage_number: 13",

It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar.\nFigure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis\nFigure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis\n(a) Initial set-up:\n- 10% sucrose solution (more solute molecules per unit volume) in arm A\n- 5% sucrose solution (fewer solute molecules per unit volume) in arm B\n- Partially permeable membrane separating the two arms\n- Water molecules and sucrose molecules shown\n(b) After osmosis:\n- Rise in level of solution in arm A\n- Drop in level due to movement of water molecules to A in arm B\n- Partially permeable membrane still in place\nCompared to arm B, arm A contains:\n- More sucrose molecules per unit volume\n- Fewer water molecules per unit volume\nAfter some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.\nWhat do you think has happened?\n- Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane.\n- Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.\nNet result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).\nThe diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis.\n#### Let's Investigate 2.4\nAim: To demonstrate osmosis\nProcedure:\n1. Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.\n2. Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.\n3. Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled.\n4. Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.\n5. Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube.\n6. After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment.\nFigure 2.16 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis\nFigure 2.16 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis\nComponents shown:\n- Paper clip\n- Sucrose solution\n- Dialysis tubing\n- Knot\n- Boiling tube\n- Distilled water\nObservation and Discussion:\n1. What can you say about the dialysis tubing? How do you account for your observation in step 6?\n2. What is the purpose of the second experimental set-up?\n#### What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?\n- The term 'water potential' is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.\n- When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.\nFigure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container\nFigure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container\n- Left side: more solute; lower water potential\n- Right side: less solute, higher water potential\n- Partially permeable membrane in the middle\n- Water potential gradient established\n- Water molecules move down a water potential gradient through a partially permeable membrane\npage_number: 14",

    "md": "Chapter 2 | Cells and the Chemistry of Life\n### Movement of Substances\nFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis.\nOsmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane.\nFigure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[direction of movement of water molecules] --> B[water potential gradient]\n    C[dilute solution] --> D[concentrated solution]\n```\n#### Tech Connect\nIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs.\nThe NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.\nFigure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment system\nReverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.\nWhy do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore?\nSimilar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:\n- water potential gradient\n- distance over which water molecules need to move\n- surface area-to-volume ratio\n### How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?\nA cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.\nNote that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.\n### What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential?\nWhen a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).\nA plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall.\nFigure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential\n1. When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell.\n2. By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.\n3. The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid.\n4. As water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure.\nLink: Human cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.\nAn animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it.\nFigure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potential\n### What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?\nCells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.\n#### Disciplinary Idea\nHomeostasis, Co-ordination and Response\nThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.\npage_number: 15",

When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell.\n2. By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane.\n3. The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp.\n4. As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential.\nPlacing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.\nFigure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential\n### Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?\nTurgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts.\nThe movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24).\nFigure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata\nPlasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis.\nInability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).\nFigure 2.25 Cells of onion leaf epidermis (stained)\n(a) Turgid plant cells\n(b) Flaccid and plasmolysed plant cells\nFigure 2.26 Effects of turgor pressure on plants\n(a) Turgor pressure in the cells of the plant helps to keep this plant firm and upright.\n(b) Loss of turgor due to excessive water loss may cause a plant to wilt.\n> **Helpful Note**\n> \n> Soil solution is a thin film of water that surrounds individual soil particles. It usually contains dissolved mineral salts or ions.\n> **Link**\n> \n> How do the stomata of plants open and close?

This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport.\nActive transport is the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[higher concentration of solute molecules, e.g. glucose] --> B[lower concentration of solute molecules, e.g. glucose]\n    B -->|diffusion down concentration gradient| A\n    A -->|active transport against concentration gradient requires energy| B\n```\nFigure 2.30 Difference between active transport and diffusion\nTable 2.3 summarises the key differences between diffusion and active transport.\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Diffusion</th>\n      <th>Active Transport</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient</td>\n      <td>Net movement of particles from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, against a concentration gradient</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Energy from respiration not required</td>\n      <td>Energy from respiration required</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Cell membrane not required</td>\n      <td>Cell membrane required</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nTable 2.3 Differences between diffusion and active transport\n#### Where Does Active Transport Occur?\nActive transport occurs only in living cells because living cells respire. It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.\nIn the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.\nIn plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution (Figure 2.31).\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[soil solution] --> B[path taken by substances absorbed by root hair cell]\n    B --> C[root hair cell]\n    D[mineral salts] --> C\n```\nFigure 2.31 Root hair cells take in dissolved mineral salts through diffusion as well as active transport.\n#### Let's Practise 2.2\n1. Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brine or syrups are used in food preservation.\n2. An animal cell is placed in a concentrated solution of sugar. Which substance will leave the cell and which will move into the cell? What processes are involved?\n#### Let's Practise 2.3\n1. Why does active transport not take place in dead cells?\n2. Name three characteristics that are different between diffusion and active transport.\npage_number: 18",

This may include sugary foods. We know that eating too much sugary foods can cause obesity, sometimes even for people who exercise regularly. Why do you think marathon runners still eat these foods?\n### 3.1 What Are Carbohydrates?\n#### Learning Outcomes\n- List the chemical elements that make up carbohydrates.\n- State that cellulose, glycogen and starch are synthesised from glucose.\n- State the main role of carbohydrates as an immediate source of energy in living organisms.\n- Describe and carry out tests for starch (using iodine in potassium iodide solution) and reducing sugars (using Benedict's solution).\n#### The Need for Food and Water\nAll living organisms need food. The food we eat contains nutrients that are essential for us. Nutrients include water, carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are three major types of biological molecules found in living organisms. Water is an essential component of all body tissues. About 70% of our body weight is water. Hence, water is extremely important to life.\n#### Carbohydrates\nFigure 3.1 shows food rich in carbohydrates.\nCarbohydrates are organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms are present in the ratio 2:1.\nFor example:\n- glucose has the formula C₆H₁₂O₆ (ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 12H : 6O = 2H : 1O)\n- sucrose (cane sugar) has the formula C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ (ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 22H : 11O = 2H : 1O)\nCarbohydrates may be classified as single sugars, double sugars or complex carbohydrates (Figure 3.2).\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Carbohydrates] --> B[Sugars]\n    A --> C[Complex carbohydrates:]\n    B --> D[Single sugars:]\n    B --> E[Double sugars:]\n    D --> F[glucose]\n    D --> G[fructose]\n    E --> H[maltose]\n    E --> I[sucrose]\n    C --> J[starch]\n    C --> K[cellulose]\n    C --> L[glycogen]\n```\nFigure 3.2 Classification of carbohydrates\n[An image shows various foods rich in carbohydrates including a bowl of white rice, a bowl of pasta, slices of bread, and some potato chips.]\nFigure 3.1 Food rich in carbohydrates\nBiological Molecules | Chapter 3\npage_number: 20",

    "md": "### How Can We Test for Reducing Sugars?\nGlucose, fructose and maltose are also known as reducing sugars. Reducing sugars will produce a red precipitate when boiled with Benedict's solution (refer to Let's Investigate 3.1). Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar and will not give a red precipitate with this test.\n#### Let's Investigate 3.1\n**Aim**\nTo test for the presence of reducing sugars in different food samples using Benedict's solution\n**Procedure**\n1. Place 2 cm³ of each food sample into a test-tube (Figure 3.6).\n2. Add 2 cm³ of Benedict's solution to the food sample (Figure 3.7).\n3. Shake the mixture and place the test-tube in a boiling water-bath for 2–3 minutes (Figure 3.8).\n4. Record the colour of the solution.\n**Observation**\nTable 3.2 shows the colour changes observed when carrying out the Benedict's test with increasing amounts of reducing sugar.\n<table>\n<caption>Table 3.2 Colour changes with different amounts of reducing sugar</caption>\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Observation</th>\n    <th>Amount Present</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Solution remained blue</td>\n    <td>No reducing sugar</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Benedict's solution turned from blue to green</td>\n    <td>Traces of reducing sugar</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Benedict's solution turned from blue to yellow or orange</td>\n    <td>Moderate amount of reducing sugar</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Benedict's solution turned from blue to red / Red precipitate formed</td>\n    <td>Large amount of reducing sugar</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nFigure 3.9 shows the colour change from blue to red indicating an increasing amount of reducing sugar present in the solutions.\n### Complex Carbohydrates\n#### What Are Complex Carbohydrates?\nA complex carbohydrate is made up of many similar molecules of single sugar joined together to form a large molecule.\nStarch, glycogen and cellulose are complex carbohydrates made up of numerous glucose molecules. The glucose molecules are linked in different ways, giving rise to different structures. Hence, starch, glycogen and cellulose have different chemical and biological properties. They also have different roles as shown in Table 3.3.\n<table>\n<caption>Table 3.3 Types of complex carbohydrates</caption>\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Complex Carbohydrate</th>\n    <th>Structure</th>\n    <th>Role</th>\n    <th>Occurrence</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Starch</td>\n    <td>A starch molecule is made up of several thousand glucose molecules joined together.</td>\n    <td>It is a storage form of carbohydrates in plants.

    "md": "## Cells and the Chemistry of Life\n### Glycogen and Starch Are Stores of Glucose\nPlants store glucose in the form of starch. Animals cannot make or store starch in their bodies. We get most of our carbohydrates from plants in the form of starch.\nIn animals, the main store of glucose is glycogen. Hence, glycogen is sometimes called 'animal starch'. In mammals, glycogen is stored mainly in the liver and the muscles (Figure 3.12).\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Starch<br>in plants] -->|consumed<br>and digested by<br>animals, forming| B[Glucose]\n    B -->|stored in<br>animals as| C[Glycogen]\n```\nFigure 3.12 Glycogen and starch as stores of glucose\nGlycogen and starch are suitable as storage materials in cells because:\n- They are insoluble in water, so they do not change the water potential in the cells.\n- They are large molecules that cannot diffuse through cell membranes, so they will not be lost from the cell.\n- They can easily be easily broken down to glucose when needed, for example, in tissue respiration.\n- Their molecules have compact shapes, so they occupy less space than all the individual glucose molecules that make up a glycogen or starch molecule.\n### Breakdown of Starch\nStarch in the foods we eat may be digested in our alimentary canal. When starch is digested, the bonds within the polysaccharide are broken and the glucose molecules are released.\nThe enzyme amylase digests starch to form the sugar maltose. Amylase cannot break maltose down to glucose. Maltose is hydrolysed to glucose by another enzyme, maltase. Note that complete digestion of starch gives glucose molecules (Figure 3.13).\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[part of a starch molecule] -->|amylase| B[maltose molecules]\n    B -->|maltase| C[glucose molecules]\n    A -->|\"amylase breaks bonds,<br>releasing maltose\"| B\n    B -->|\"further bond-breaking by<br>maltase releases individual<br>glucose molecules\"| C\n```\nFigure 3.13 Digestion of starch\n### What Are the Functions of Carbohydrates?\nCarbohydrates are needed:\n- as a substrate for respiration, to provide energy for cell activities;\n- to form supporting structures, for example, cell walls in plants;\n- to be converted into other organic compounds such as amino acids and fats;\n- for the formation of nucleic acids, for example, DNA;\n- to synthesise lubricants, for example, mucus, which consists of a carbohydrate and a protein; and\n- to synthesise the nectar in some flowers. Nectar is a sweet liquid that plants produce to attract insects.\n### How Can We Test for Starch?\nStarch can be detected by the iodine test. A few drops of iodine solution to any substance containing starch will produce a blue-black colour.\n#### Let's Investigate 3.2\nAim: To test for the presence of starch in a food sample using iodine solution\nProcedure:\n1. Add a few drops of iodine in potassium iodide solution to a food sample.\n2. Record your observations.\nObservation: Iodine solution on the potato turns from brown to blue-black upon contact with starch in the food sample (Figure 3.14).\nFigure 3.14 Iodine solution on the food sample turns from brown to blue-black.\n#### Let's Practise 3.1\n1. Describe how you would test for reducing sugars in a food sample.\n2. Describe how you would test for starch in a food sample.\n3. Outline the role of carbohydrates in the life of an organism.\n4. What do you think will happen if you add some amylase to a starch solution and test the resulting solution with Benedict's solution after five minutes?\npage_number: 23",

These are oils or fats (Figure 3.15). Where do they come from, and what does the body do with them?\n#### Fats\nFats are a type of lipid.\nFats, like carbohydrates, are organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. But unlike carbohydrates, fats contain much less oxygen in proportion to hydrogen.\nFor example, tristearin (beef fat) has the formula C₅₇H₁₁₀O₆. Note how little oxygen it contains in proportion to hydrogen. The proportions of the elements that make up fats are not fixed, so there is no general formula for fats.\nFats can be animal fats or plant fats. Fats are commonly used as a store of energy, especially by animals.\n#### Fats Can Be Broken Down into Fatty Acids and Glycerol\nFats can be broken down into simpler compounds such as fatty acids and glycerol. Refer to the general equation shown in Figure 3.16.\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[fat molecule] -->|enzyme| B[glycerol]\n    A -->|enzyme| C[three fatty acid molecules]\n```\nFigure 3.16 A fat molecule breaks down into glycerol and fatty acid.\nThe reaction involves an enzyme. For example, when tristearin is broken down by the enzyme lipase, stearic acid and glycerol are produced:\ntristearin --lipase--> glycerol + three stearic acid molecules (an example of fatty acid)\n#### What Are the Sources of Fats?\n- Foods that are rich in fats include butter, cheese, fatty meat, olives, many nuts, peas, beans, seeds of castor oil and palm oil (Figure 3.17).\n- The meat of most fishes and 'white meats' have relatively less fats. However, some fishes such as herring and salmon have lots of fats.\nFigure 3.17 Examples of food rich in fats\n#### What Are the Functions of Fats?\nHow are some animals able to survive in cold climate, while others are not able to? What are the features common to these animals? How do these features help them to survive in the cold?\nFats function as:\n- A source and a long-term storage of energy.\n  – They are a suitable long-term storage material because fats have a higher energy value compared to carbohydrates.\n- An insulating material that prevents excessive heat loss. For example, animals such as seals have a thick layer of fat (blubber) beneath the skin, which helps to reduce loss of body heat (Figure 3.18).\n- A solvent for fat-soluble vitamins and many other vital substances such as hormones.\n- An essential part of cells, especially in cell membranes.\n- A way to reduce water loss from the skin surface. Glands in the skin secrete an oily substance.\n  – This oily substance forms a thin layer over the skin surface, reducing the rate of evaporation of water.\n  – The oily substance also reduces the rate of heat loss from the skin.\nFigure 3.18 Seals and polar bears have a thick layer of fat beneath their skin, which helps reduce heat loss.\n<div style=\"background-color: #FFFF00; padding: 10px;\">\n<strong>Disciplinary Idea</strong><br>\n<strong>Energy</strong><br>\nFats are one of the energy stores of animals.

    "md": "### How Can We Test for Fats?\nThe ethanol emulsion test is a test for the presence of fats. A white emulsion is formed when ethanol and water are added to fats. An emulsion is a suspension of small drops of a liquid in another liquid.\n#### Let's Investigate 3.3\nAim: To test for the presence of fats in food samples using the ethanol emulsion test\nProcedure:\n1. On samples in liquid state (e.g. coconut oil):\n   (a) Add 2 cm³ of ethanol to a drop of liquid sample in a test-tube and shake the mixture thoroughly.\n   (b) Add 2 cm³ of water to the mixture and shake the mixture.\n   (c) Record your observation.\n2. On samples in solid state (e.g. peanut):\n   (a) Crush the solid sample into small pieces using a mortar and pestle and place the pieces in a test-tube.\n   (b) Add 2 cm³ of ethanol into the test-tube and shake thoroughly.\n   (c) Allow the solid particles to settle. Carefully decant the ethanol (pour off the top layer of ethanol) into another test-tube containing 2 cm³ of water and shake the mixture.\n   (d) Record your observation.\nObservation: The white emulsion produced indicates the presence of fats (Figure 3.19).\n#### Let's Practise 3.2\n1. List the chemical elements that make up fats.\n2. List three functions of fats.\n3. Describe how you would test for fats in a food sample.\nHow has our opinion of eating eggs changed over time? In the past, eggs were considered bad for our health and we were discouraged from eating more than two per week. Now, eggs are considered by some nutritionists as the \"perfect food\". They are believed to contain all the necessary nutrients that are good for our growth and maintenance of the body (Figure 3.20). Eggs also contain cholesterol, which is a type of lipid.\nWhat about the discussion on cholesterol intake? Is the amount of cholesterol found in our blood determined by how much cholesterol we take in from food? Or is cholesterol manufactured by our bodies from other types of nutrients? Are all forms of cholesterol bad for our health?\nOur knowledge of nutrients, and the roles they play in our lives, keeps maturing as we gain a better understanding of how our bodies function.\nWhat attitudes should we embrace as we continue to explore this topic and discover more insights on food and nutrients? How should we behave when these insights from the latest research studies contradict what we thought we knew about the topic?\n### 3.3 What Are Proteins?\n#### Learning Outcomes\n- List the chemical elements that make up proteins.\n- State that polypeptides and protein are synthesised from amino acids.\n- State the main roles of proteins for growth and repair of cells in living organisms.\n- Describe and carry out tests for protein (using biuret solution).\nVegetarians are people who choose not to eat meat. Instead of consuming meat as a source of protein, they eat a lot more dairy (milk-based) or soy products. This is because proteins are essential nutrients and so alternative sources of protein must be consumed to ensure a healthy and balanced diet.\n#### Proteins\nProteins are organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Another element, sulfur, may also be present.\nProteins are always present in all cells. Their molecules are the largest and most complicated of all the food substances. Proteins are commonly found in the meat of animals (Figure 3.21).\n#### Amino Acids — the Building Blocks of Proteins\nA protein molecule is built up from simpler compounds known as amino acids. An amino acid is made up of an amino group (–NH₂), an acidic group (–COOH) and a side chain (denoted by R, which may sometimes contain sulfur). The general formula for an amino acid can be written as:\n```\n    R\n    |\nNH₂–CH–COOH\n```\nThere are 20 different naturally occurring amino acids, for example, methionine and valine. They differ because of their different R groups. Amino acids are combined in various ways to form millions of different protein molecules, just as the 26 letters of the alphabet can be used to form a very large number of words.\npage_number: 25",

    "md": "## Long Chains of Amino Acids Fold to Give Proteins a Three-dimensional Shape\nMany amino acid molecules are joined in a linear manner to form a polypeptide. Polypeptides in turn may be linked up to form an even longer chain of amino acids. A protein molecule is made up of one or more such chains folded together (Figure 3.22). In most proteins, the polypeptide chains are folded into a more complex, three-dimensional shape.\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[amino acids] --> B[polypeptide]\n    B --> C[protein]\n    linkStyle 0 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:black;\n    linkStyle 1 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:black;\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n```\nFigure 3.22 Amino acids are joined to form polypeptides, which link up to form even longer chains of amino acids.\n### What Are the Sources of Proteins?\nProteins can be found in both animal and plant foods. Milk, eggs, seafood and meat, such as chicken and lean beef, are some animal foods rich in proteins (Figure 3.23). Plant foods rich in proteins include soya beans, nuts, grains and vegetables such as French beans.\n### What Are the Functions of Proteins?\nProteins are used in the:\n- synthesis of new cytoplasm, for growth and repair of worn-out body cells;\n- synthesis of enzymes and some hormones; and\n- formation of antibodies to combat diseases.\n[Image showing examples of protein-rich foods including meat, eggs, milk, nuts, and beans]\nFigure 3.23 Examples of plant and animal proteins\n### How Can We Test for Proteins?\nProteins can be detected by the biuret test. The biuret solution is a blue solution made up of sodium hydroxide and copper(II) sulfate. It turns violet (deep purple) when proteins are present.\n#### Let's Investigate 3.4\n**Aim**  \nTo test for the presence of proteins in a food sample (e.g. egg white) using biuret solution\n**Procedure**\n1. To 2 cm³ of liquid food sample (e.g. egg white), add an equal volume of biuret solution.\n2. Shake well and allow the mixture to stand for five minutes.\n3. Record your observation.\n[Image showing a test tube with violet-colored liquid]\nFigure 3.24 A violet (deep purple) colour indicates the presence of proteins. In the absence of proteins, the solution will remain blue.\n**Observation**  \nA violet colour indicates the presence of proteins (Figure 3.24).\n**Question**  \nWhat colour changes do you observe when the egg white is mixed with biuret solution?\n#### Let's Practise 3.3\n1. (a) List the chemical elements that make up proteins.\n   (b) List three functions of proteins.\n2. Describe how you would test for proteins in a food sample.\n3. Food tests were carried out on three different foods, labelled A, B and C. The results of the tests are given in Table 3.4.\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Test</th>\n      <th>A</th>\n      <th>B</th>\n      <th>C</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Add iodine solution</td>\n      <td>Iodine remains brown</td>\n      <td>Iodine remains brown</td>\n      <td>Blue-black colour observed</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Heat with Benedict's solution</td>\n      <td>Red precipitate formed</td>\n      <td>Red precipitate formed</td>\n      <td>Solution remains blue</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Add biuret solution</td>\n      <td>Solution remains blue</td>\n      <td>Violet colour observed</td>\n      <td>Violet colour observed</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nTable 3.4 Results of food tests\n(a) Using the results from the table, state what substances are present in each food.\n(b) Describe how you would test for fats in a piece of skin from an orange.\n(c) Outline the role of proteins in the life of an organism.\nChapter 3 | Cells and the Chemistry of Life\nBiological Molecules | Chapter 3\npage_number: 26",

    "md": "### How Can We Identify the Different Nutrients Present in Our Food?\nYou can carry out food tests on a variety of foods, for example, peanut, cucumber, onion, tomato and banana in order to find out what nutrients they contain. The following points in Let's Investigate 3.5 are worth noting.\n#### Let's Investigate 3.5\n1. To test a food for presence of reducing sugars or proteins, cut the food into small pieces or grind up the food with a pestle and mortar (Figure 3.25). This helps to break the cells and release the food substances so as to make a concentrated solution for testing.\n   (a) Place some crushed pieces of food in a test-tube. Add 2 cm³ of water to the test-tube to dissolve the sugars and proteins in the food.\n   (b) Decant the solution into another test-tube.\n   (c) Perform Benedict's or biuret test with the solution. (Refer to Let's Investigate 3.1 and 3.4 respectively.)\n2. To test for starch, use the iodine test in Let's Investigate 3.2.\n3. To test for fats, use the ethanol emulsion test in Let's Investigate 3.3.\n### Cool Career: Nutrition Coach\nNutrition coaches work with their clients to guide them towards a healthy lifestyle (Figure 3.26). They help their clients to incorporate healthy eating behaviours into their lifestyle.\nTo be successful at this, nutrition coaches need to have a good knowledge of what nutrients can do for our health. They must have a good understanding of human behaviour, especially when people are faced with changes in life. They can incorporate healthy diets into the programmes to build the physical fitness of their clients.\nNow, look at Figure 3.27. Do you agree with what is said here?

    "md": "## 4.1 What Are Enzymes?\n### Learning Outcome\n- Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in all metabolic reactions.\n### Biological Catalysts\nBiological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.\n> A catalyst is a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction.\nFor example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.\npotassium chlorate(VII) <strong>strong heat</strong> → potassium chloride + oxygen\nWhen potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced. If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide:\n- allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and\n- speeds up the reaction.\nAt the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst (Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boiling or by changes in the pH of the solution.\nIn the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes.\n### Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts\nEnzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.\nEnzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.\n### Enzymes Lower Activation Energy\nFat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed.\nThe energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2).\nFigure 4.2 Activation energy is needed to start a chemical reaction.\n1. Imagine a chemical reaction as the process of rolling a huge stone (reactant) up a hill so that it rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products).\n2. Activation energy is the energy needed to roll the stone up the hill. Once over the hill, the rest of the reaction occurs. The stone rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products are formed).\nEnzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the 'height' of the 'hill'. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.\nFor example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 °C).\nFigure 4.3 Activation energy for an enzyme-catalysed reaction\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Energy</th>\n    <th></th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>reactants<br>(glucose + oxygen)</td>\n    <td>activation energy<br>without enzyme</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>activation energy<br>with enzyme</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>products<br>(carbon dioxide + water)</td>\n    <td>overall energy<br>change</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Time →</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nNote: If the overall energy change is negative, there is a decrease in energy content (as shown in graph). If the overall energy change is positive, there is an increase in energy content.\nChapter 4 | Cells and the Chemistry of Life\npage_number: 29",

However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes.",

    "md": "### What Reactions Do Enzymes Catalyse?\nSome food molecules are large and insoluble in water. These molecules cannot diffuse through the cell membrane.\nEnzymes are required to break these large molecules into simpler and smaller substances so that they are:\n- soluble in water\n- small enough to diffuse through the cell membrane (Figure 4.4)\nEnzymes that are involved in digestion are known as digestive enzymes. Examples of digestive enzymes are:\n- amylase — digests starch to maltose\n- maltase — digests maltose to glucose\n- protease — digests proteins to polypeptides, then to amino acids\n- lipase — digests fats to fatty acids and glycerol\n### Enzymes Either Build Up or Break Down Complex Substances\nEnzymes are also involved in biological reactions. Enzyme-catalysed reactions can be classified into:\n- reactions that build up complex substances (anabolic reactions)\n- reactions that break down complex substances (catabolic reactions)\nFigure 4.5 shows examples of processes in which enzymes are involved.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Enzymes]\n    B[Build up complex substances]\n    C[Break down complex substances]\n    A --> B\n    A --> C\n    B --> D[Cells build up or synthesise complex substances from simpler ones.]\n    C --> E[Cells break down complex substances to simple substances.]\n    D --> F[For example:]\n    E --> G[For example:]\n    F --> H[Amino acids taken into the cells may be used to build up proteins.

Both plant and animal cells produce the enzyme catalase to break down hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, hence removing the toxic effect. Catalase is especially abundant in blood and the liver of mammals.]\n    F --> L[In photosynthesis, glucose is synthesised from carbon dioxide and water. The chemical reactions involved in photosynthesis are controlled by enzymes.]\n```\nFigure 4.5 Two types of enzyme-catalysed reactions\nFrom the above functions of enzymes, it is important to note that enzymes catalyse practically all the chemical reactions that occur in an organism. However, enzymes are produced only when they are needed. For example, digestive enzymes are produced only when there is food to digest in the alimentary canal.\n![Figure 4.4 Only small molecules such as glucose and amino acids can pass through the cell membrane.]\nThe image shows a diagram of a cell membrane with various molecules. Large starch and protein molecules are shown outside the cell, unable to pass through the membrane. Enzymes like amylase, maltase, and protease break down these large molecules into smaller glucose and amino acid molecules, which can then pass through pores in the cell membrane into the cell's interior.\npage_number: 30",

For example, protein is the substrate on which a protease acts.\nAccording to the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis, enzyme reactions depend on the presence of active sites (Figure 4.8). Active sites are grooves (depressions) or 'pockets' on the surface of an enzyme molecule into which the substrate molecule(s) with the matching shape can fit — just like a lock and key. The enzyme is the lock, and the substrate is the key.\n<div style=\"background-color: #e6f3e6; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;\">\n<strong>Disciplinary Idea</strong><br>\n<strong>Structure and Function</strong><br>\nThe structure of biological molecules affects their functions.

Only the substrate with a 3-D shape complementary to that of the active site can fit into the enzyme. This results in the formation of an enzyme–substrate complex. The enzyme is just like a lock and the substrate a key. The substrate fits into the enzyme just like a key fits into a lock. This is called the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis.\n3. While the substrate is attached to the active site, a chemical reaction occurs. The substrate is converted to the products.\n4. Later, the products leave the active site. The enzyme remains unchanged. It can catalyse another reaction.\n<div style=\"background-color: #fffae6; padding: 5px; display: inline-block;\">\n<strong>Word Alert</strong><br>\nComplementary: matching\n</div>\npage_number: 32",

    "md": "### Characteristics of Enzymes\n#### Enzymes Speed Up Chemical Reactions\nEnzymes alter the rates of chemical reactions that occur in a cell. Enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy needed to start the reaction.\n#### Enzymes Are Specific in Action\nEnzymes have active sites. Only substrates with a shape complementary to the active site can fit into the enzymes. When an enzyme binds to its substrate, it forms an enzyme–substrate complex. However, high temperature, acids and alkalis can affect the shape of an enzyme and consequently its function.\n#### Enzymes Are Required in Minute Amounts and Remain Unchanged at the End of Reactions\nEnzymes are very efficient molecules. Since they remain unchanged in the reactions they catalyse, the same enzyme molecules can be used over and over again. Thus, a small amount of an enzyme can catalyse the reaction for a large amount of substrate. For example, just a spoonful of washing powder containing enzymes is enough to wash a large load of clothing.\n#### Enzymes Are Affected by Temperature\nFigure 4.10 shows the effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction.\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Temperature] --> B[Rate of reaction<br/>(enzyme activity)]\n    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    B --> C[1]\n    B --> D[2]\n    B --> E[3]\n    B --> F[4]\n    B --> G[5]\n    E --> H[optimum temperature]\n```\nFigure 4.10 Effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction\n1. An enzyme is less active at low temperatures.\n   At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low.\n2. As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.\n   Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation.\n3. This is the optimum temperature, where the enzyme is most active.\n   For most human enzymes, the optimum temperature is about 40–45 °C.\n4. Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction.\n   The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules.\n5. At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been denatured.\n   Most enzymes are denatured.\nDenaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis.\nDenaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme's active site (Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme's active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst.\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[folded protein with<br/>intact active site] --> B[denaturation]\n    B --> C[denatured protein<br/>(active site is lost)]\n    A --> D[substrate<br/>molecule]\n    C --> E[substrate<br/>molecule]\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style D fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style E fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n```\nFigure 4.11 At temperatures above optimum, some enzymes are denatured. Enzymes lose their active sites when they are denatured.\n### Let's Investigate 4.1\n#### Aim\nTo find out how temperature affects enzyme action\n#### Procedure\n1. Label and fill test-tubes A₁, B₁, C₁ and D₁ with 5 cm³ of starch solution respectively.\n2. Label and fill test-tube D₂ with 3 cm³ of distilled water, and test-tubes A₂, B₂ and C₂ with 3 cm³ of amylase solution respectively.\n3. Set up the experiment (see Figure 4.12 on the next page) by placing the test-tubes into water-baths of varying temperatures as shown in the table below.\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Test-tubes</th>\n    <th>A₁, A₂</th>\n    <th>B₁, B₂</th>\n    <th>C₁, C₂</th>\n    <th>D₁, D₂</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Temperature / ˚C</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>37</td>\n    <td>100</td>\n    <td>37</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n4. After 5 minutes, pour the contents of test-tubes A₂, B₂, C₂ and D₂ into test-tubes A₁, B₁, C₁ and D₁, respectively. Shake to mix the contents in each test-tube. Return the test-tubes to their respective water baths.\n5. After 1 minute, remove one drop from each solution with a dropping pipette and put it in the well in the plate provided. Then test it with a drop of iodine solution. (The solution turns blue-black if starch is present.)\n6. Continue step 5 at 1-minute intervals until the iodine solution remains brown. This shows that all the starch has been digested.\n7. Record the total time (T) taken (in minutes) for the starch in each test-tube to be completely digested.\npage_number: 33",

The iodine solution turned blue-black when test-tube A₁ was tested for starch at the various 1-minute intervals.\n2. The iodine solution remained brown when test-tube B₁ was tested for starch after T minutes.\n3. The iodine solution turned blue-black when test-tube C₁ was tested for starch at the various 1-minute intervals.\n4. The iodine solution turned blue-black when test-tube D₁ was tested for starch at the various 1-minute intervals.\n**Conclusion**\n1. The less time taken to digest starch, the more active the enzyme is.\n   In this investigation, enzyme activity is measured by calculating\n   $\\frac{1}{T}$ (the reciprocal of the time taken to digest starch). What can you\n   conclude about the effect of temperature on the activity of amylase\n   from the graph of $\\frac{1}{T}$ against temperature?\n### Enzymes Are Affected by pH\nEnzymes are affected by the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions in which they act. Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease in the stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinal enzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary from the optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes.\nIn Figure 4.13, point M indicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH of about 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) or alkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, the enzyme is completely denatured.\n#### Figure 4.13 Effect of pH on the rate of reactions catalysed by different enzymes\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Rate of enzyme activity] --> B[protease in stomach]\n    A --> C[amylase M]\n    A --> D[protease in small intestine]\n    E[pH] --> F[1]\n    E --> G[3]\n    E --> H[5]\n    E --> I[7]\n    E --> J[9]\n    E --> K[optimum pH]\n```\n### Tech Connect\nSome COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at low temperatures for them to be effective. In some instances, the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as –70 °C.\nAt this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that could break down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccine are literally frozen to a halt. Scientists and engineers thus need to design, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain such sub-arctic temperatures. They also need to design and construct containers that can store and transport large quantities of the vaccines across the world, from the place where it is manufactured to reach different countries.\nThese special freezers and containers are examples of technology in action. Engineers apply their knowledge in cooling systems to design and build machines that work to prevent enzymatic reactions on the vaccine ingredients during storage and transport (Figure 4.14).\n#### Figure 4.14 Storage of Covid-19 vaccine in freezers\n[Image shows vials of COVID-19 vaccine stored in a specialized freezer]\nYou have learnt how enzymes break down large molecules in food into smaller molecules. Now look at Figure 4.15. What are your views on the statements made by the three people?\n#### Figure 4.15 Three people are discussing the effect of enzymes on silk clothing. What is your view?\n[Image shows three people discussing, with speech bubbles containing their statements]\nPerson A: \"If a shirt is made of silk and silk is a protein, can the shirt be digested by enzymes?\"\nPerson B: \"I don't think that can happen. Many people wear silk. Moreover, silk is not a nutrient. So, how can it be digested?\"\nPerson C: \"I think it can happen, especially if the right enzymes are used! Since silk is a protein, it can be digested by a protease.
